Figure 59. Connections between the NTS and other major autonomic brain regions. The caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dorsal vagal nucleus, DVN), nucleus ambiguus (NA), and supramedullary sites, including the hypothalamus, are reciprocally connected to the NTS. The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) receives monosynaptic inputs from the commissural NTS. The DVN, NA, and RVLM are major efferent pathways of the parasympathetic and sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.
