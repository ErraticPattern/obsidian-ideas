# Patch-clamp

In vitro recordings. An easy way to verify if the object of a electrophysiological study is to measure current or voltage is to analyse the label present in one of the axis of some figure. If fEPSP (field excitatory post-synaptic potential) is present, then it is an extracellular recording (due to the prefix f which means field) which is analysing voltage amplitude (due to the word potential) after a stimulus. If it is EPSC (excitatory post-synaptic current) then it is a voltage-clamp study which is measuring a current. If it is EPSP then it is a current-clamp study.
