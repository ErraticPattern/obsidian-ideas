# Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs)

The normative data obtained with this technique is composed of the N75, P100 and N145 signals. It is more sensitive than MRI or physical examination for prechiasmatic lesions but not so for postchiasmatic lesions.

Figure 116. Damage to the retino-geniculo-calcarine pathway may result in altered latencies and amplitudes. II. Brainstem auditory evoked responses or potentials (BAER). The auditory stimulus is a series of clicks or tones, with recording done over the temporal lobe auditory cortex. Seven distinctive peak latencies occur: I. distal auditory nerve; II. proximal auditory nerve; III. cochlear nuclei; IV. superior olivary complex; V. nucleus of the lateral lemniscus; VI. inferior colliculus; and VII. medial geniculate nucleus. Altered latencies and amplitudes may indicate damage or disruption to the auditory pathway at specific sites ([Source](https://www.pediagenosis.com/2020/07/visual-and-auditory-evoked-potentials.html)).
