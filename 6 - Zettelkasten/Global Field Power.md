# Global Field Power

In order to obtain EEG microstates from resting-state or spontaneous EEG, global field power (GFP) is computed, which can be considered as a reference-independent, single measure of response strength to an event or any change in the brain activity. A few of these topographies dominate in resting-state EEG.

Figure 111. The GFP is simply given as the root mean square across average-referenced electrode values at a given time instant, where $V_n(t)$ is the electric potential at electrode $n$ at time $t$ and $\hat{V}(t)$ is the average over $M$ electrodes at time $t$.
