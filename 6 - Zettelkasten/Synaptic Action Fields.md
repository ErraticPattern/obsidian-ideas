# Synaptic Action Fields
> [!remark]
> The field description appears useful if the field variable represents neocortical synaptic action integrated over sub-millimeter scales. The columnar structure of neocortex suggests a slightly modified definition of synaptic action fields as the numbers of active excitatory or inhibitory synapses per unit area of neocortical surface.

> [!definition]
> The number densities of active excitatory and inhibitory [[Synapses]], expressed as functions of time and cortical location are here assigned the symbols $W_e(\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $W_i(\mathbf{r}, t)$, respectively; these are **field variables**.

> [!important]
> The idea of synaptic action fields is partly motivated by its causal connection to current sources, that is, the so-called generators of [[EEG]].

+ *The synaptic action fields are distinct from the electric and magnetic fields that they generate. While controversial reports of small [[electric field]] actions on nervous tissue have been published, we do not consider the possibility of such interaction in this book. We do, however, postulate interactions between synaptic action fields and cell assemblies.*

# Notes
Interesting to note that the effect of electric fields on nervous tissue is still debatable.
