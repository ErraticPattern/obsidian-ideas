## Definition
[[kaneRevisedGlossaryTerms2017]] defined channel as: 
>[!quote]
>Complete system for the detection, amplification and display of potential differences between a pair of electrodes, or a computed reference (for example common average reference). Digital EEG machines simulate a multichannel display by tracing several voltage time plots on a visual display.

[[pernetIssuesRecommendationsOHBM2020]] defined it as:
>[!quote]
>Channels refer to the digital signals that have been recorded by the amplifiers. It is thus important to distinguish them from sensors. A ‘bad channel’ refers to a channel that is producing a consistently artifactual or low-quality signal.

Based on these definitions, channels can be defined as the signals created by system converting the original analog system into an amplified digital signal.
