# Laplacian
+ *In fact, another high-resolution method, the New Orleans spline-Laplacian, which is nearly independent of head model, yields contour plots that are almost identical to those obtained by Melbourne dura imaging* (Nunez and Srinivasan, Electric Fields of the Brain).

# Notes
It is interesting that the Laplacian yielded similar results as the [[Dura Imaging]] algorithm. I should try to find the why of this relationship.
