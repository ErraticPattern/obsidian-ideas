# Geodesic

>"Geodesic" is just the name we give to the shortest path on a surface between two points.
>- For planes or 3-dimensional Euclidean space, geodesics are just straight lines.
>- On a sphere, the geodesics turn out to be "great circles". That is, a circle resulting from intersecting the sphere with a plane that passes through the sphere's center.
>- For an oblate spheroid, the geodesics are tougher to identify. Any plane passing through both poles of the spheroid will produce a geodesic. The equator is also a geodesic. But if you consider two points that not directly north and south of each other, and do not both lie on the equator, the geodesic between them is not easily described.
