# EEG microstates

EEG microstates represent a dynamical view of how the spatial distribution of the electric potential on the scalp changes over time. Microstates typically last 80-100 ms.

Essentially, each microstate is a topography of electric potential over EEG electrodes, which remain stable for a certain duration, before jumping or transitioning into a new and distinct topography. Thus the topographical maps configuration do not evolve in time randomly and continuously, but in a rather discrete and abrupt fashion, after remaining stable for a certain duration. Also, within the period of this stable time window, the strength of the field increases and decreases, but the topography remains the same.
