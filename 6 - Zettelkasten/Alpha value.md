# Alpha value
It should represent a critical value of a particular test statistic such that, under the null hypothesis, the probability of exceeding this critical value is *controlled*. While the standard assigned alpha is of 0.05, when confronted with the [[Multiple comparison problem|MCP]] this critical value must be changed accordingly.
