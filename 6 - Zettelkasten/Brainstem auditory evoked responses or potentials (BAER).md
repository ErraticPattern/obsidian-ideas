Figure 117. Schematic representation of the auditory pathway and corresponding AEP components through stimulation with a click. These components include the auditory short-latency responses or auditory brainstem responses (ABR) (waves I-VI) (blue), the auditory middle latency responses (N0-Pb) (red), and the auditory late-latency responses (N1-P3) (green). Localization of the neuronal generators of the ABR waves are also depicted. Created with BioRender.com, AEPs adapted from Burkard et al. (21), Lammers (29) (Bao et al., n.d.).
