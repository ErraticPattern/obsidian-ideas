# Cell Assembly
> [!definition]
> We view the cell assembly concept broadly here to indicate any group of neurons or neural masses (minicolumns, corticocortical columns, macrocolumns, and so forth) for which preferential interactions persist over time intervals of perhaps several tens of milliseconds or more.

> [!tip]
> Cell assemblies in neocortex appear more likely to form in contiguous structures as a result of dense intracortical connections, but cortical regions separated by large distances (say 10 to 20 cm) may evidently also interact preferentially. This latter idea is plausible because of the extreme interconnectedness of human brains, greatly facilitated by the numerous [[Cortico-cortical Fibers]].

# Notes
Indeed it is an interesting concept.
