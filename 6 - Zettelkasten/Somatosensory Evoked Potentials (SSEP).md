# Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP)

Elicited from the upper and lower limbs within 30 ms and 60 ms, respectively, of percutaneous electrical stimulation. Sites of stimulation are usually the medial nerve, for upper limbs, and the posterior tibial nerve, for lower limbs; normative values for upper limb’s SSEP don’t vary much, contrary to lower limb’s SSEP. Recording electrodes are placed in anatomical landmarks; those on the head are placed according to the 10-20 or 10-10 system, like in an EEG.
