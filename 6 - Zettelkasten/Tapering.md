# Tapering
Tapering results in lower power in [[Power spectral density]] and smooths it out. In general, tapering with different windows does not produce much different results. Tapering might not always be necessary as the results can be very similar. Interestingly, [[Hann window]]  suppresses more signal at the edges in comparison to the [[Hamming window]] or a [[Gaussian]] window.
