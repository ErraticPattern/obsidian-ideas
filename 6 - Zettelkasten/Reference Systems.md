A basic EEG acquisition system usually consists of three electrodes including an active electrode (A), a reference electrode (R), and a grounding electrode (G). The AG potentials and RG potentials are then connected to a differential amplifier to eliminate environmental electrical activity. Therefore, EEG not only reflects the electrical activity on where the active electrode is placed but also the potential difference between the location of the active electrode and the reference electrode.
