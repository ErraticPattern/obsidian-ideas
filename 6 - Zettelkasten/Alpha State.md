# Alpha State
+ *In particular, since the alpha rhythm tends to disappear with eyes open, its origin was first suspected to be a rhythmic beat of eye muscles* (Nunez and Srinivasan, Electric Fields of the Brain).
+ *Chronic drug use (whether for medical or recreational purposes) can cause long-lasting and perhaps permanent effects on normal brain rhythms* (Nunez and Srinivasan, Electric Fields of the Brain).

# Notes
I should start seeing this difference in alpha band power in my EEG recordings.
