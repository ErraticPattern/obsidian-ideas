# Alpha State
>[!quote]
>Alpha waves are oscillations at approximately 10 Hz that are largest over posterior electrode sites and are particularly large when the participant is zoned out or has closed eyes. I like to think of alpha waves as indicating that the participant’s attention is internally focused instead of externally focused. In most experiments, you want the subject to be alert and paying attention externally to the task, so you don’t want to see alpha waves. However, most ERP experiments are pretty boring, so the participants are often a little sleepy and generate quite a bit of alpha. When a participant produces a lot of alpha, we often give them a break and offer a caffeinated beverage.
## Associations
+ *In particular, since the alpha rhythm tends to disappear with eyes open, its origin was first suspected to be a rhythmic beat of eye muscles* (Nunez and Srinivasan, Electric Fields of the Brain).
+ *Chronic drug use (whether for medical or recreational purposes) can cause long-lasting and perhaps permanent effects on normal brain rhythms* (Nunez and Srinivasan, Electric Fields of the Brain).

# Notes
I should start seeing this difference in alpha band power in my EEG recordings.
