# Voltage clamp

In voltage-clamp experiments, the voltage is clamped, i.e., fixed, by the voltage clamp amplifier which fixes the value of the voltage. The amount of current given by the latter to fixate the voltage is recorded. This technique allows for the study of electrical activity, in physiological conditions or otherwise.
