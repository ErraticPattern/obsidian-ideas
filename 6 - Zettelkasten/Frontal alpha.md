>*FA was computed as the average of the baseline-corrected alpha power (8–12.5 Hz) from frontal electrodes (F3, F4, F7, F8, FP1, FP2, AFz, Fz).* 

Note they used a [[Smarting wireless mobile EEG]] with the following layout: 
>[!quote]
>*24 electrodes were placed according to the [[10–20 standard system]] (FP1, FP2, FPz (DRL), F7, F8, Fz, FC1, FC2, FCz (CMS), Cz, C3, C4, T7, T8, CPz, CP1, CP2, CP5, CP6, TP9, TP10, Pz, P3, P4, O1, and O2).*

They had less electrodes than those present in a standard 32-channel EEG system.
