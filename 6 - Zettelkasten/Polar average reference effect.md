The polar average reference effect builds on the average reference system by interpolation what the EEG activity would be on the whole surface of the head, which is unknowable in practice since there is no system that covers all of the headâ€™s surface. By interpolating all of the activity we would be using a better system to signify a true absolute voltage without the slight bias that the average reference creates towards the regions of the head with the electrodes.
