# Extracellular recordings

Ex vivo recordings. The most common places for electrophysiological analysis are the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex. The reference electrode is situated in the medium (Artificial CSF solution) and the recording electrode is situated in the tissue. The stimulus electrode is placed in the respective areas; they are usually used in pairs, one serving as the control electrode and the other as the test electrode.

Extracellular recordings give data on the **Local Field Potential (LFP)**, which is the electric potential recorded in the extracellular space in brain tissue, typically using micro-electrodes (metal, silicon, or glass micropipettes). LFPs differ from the electroencephalogram (EEG), which is recorded at the surface of the scalp, and with macro-electrodes.

**Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF)** is a form of short-term, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity common to most chemically transmitting synapses, manifested as an enhancement in the amplitude of the second of two rapidly evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). It is frequently used as an indirect measurement of changes in the probability of release of neurotransmitter at the presynaptic terminal. The generally accepted explanation of PPF posits that residual intraterminal free [Ca(2+)] from the first action potential facilitates the probability of transmitter release evoked by the second stimulus. PPF can be given in a 4x4 burst with 200 ms of interval between each train. This facilitation differs on LTP since it is of short duration and affects only the probability of pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release.

**The neuronal input/output (I/O) function** (a curve) determines the likelihood that a neuron elicits an action potential in response to synaptic input of a given strength. This method of representation is used for studies of LTP induction.

The data of the recording is composed of 3 moments, represented in the figure below:
