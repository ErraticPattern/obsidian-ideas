# Neural Dust
[[Neural Dust]] is an innovative technology that consists of
tiny, wireless sensors designed to be implanted in the
body to monitor and interact with nerves, muscles, or
organs. These sensors are powered and communicate
using ultrasound, which allows them to operate deep
within the body without the need for batteries or wires, i.e. without the need of electromagnetic fields ([[electric field]]).
