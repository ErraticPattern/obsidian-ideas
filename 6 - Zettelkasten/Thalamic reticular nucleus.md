# Notes
This is the only thalamic nucleus that does not project to the [[Cerebral cortex]].
It has three oscillatory modes (spindles): [[Alpha State|alpha]], [[Delta band|delta]], [[Gamma band|gamma]]. The alpha oscillation is related to resting membrane potential. Therefore, a higher metabolic rate reflects cellular activity and should suppress alpha power ([[On EEG's generative mechanism]]). I wonder how much of this alpha spindles are reflected on the EEG.
