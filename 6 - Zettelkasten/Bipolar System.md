# Bipolar System

Additionally, there is a bipolar setup, in which each electrode’s signal is subtracted the signal of that one coming afterwards in the chosen axis. The bipolar setup can have different configurations such as the banana shape configuration, in the ventral-dorsal axis, and the inter-hemispherical configuration, in the right-left axis ([[#^footnote-16|Comment Unknown Author 16]]). There is also the referential setup, in which each electrodes’ signal is compared to that of the reference electrode, situate in the ear.
