Figure 94. Diagram of REST. (A) measured EEG potentials vCz with reference to Cz; j and KCz are the actual source activities and the actual lead field with reference to Cz, respectively; (B) for REST, one first builds the lead field Kˆ ∞ with estimated head model and equivalent sources, then transforms the lead field with reference to Cz as KˆCz; with this lead field, one enables to estimate the equivalent source activities ˆj; after, the equivalent source activities are taken the forward calculation through Kˆ ∞ to ϕˆ ∞ which is the approximation of EEG potentials at infinity.
