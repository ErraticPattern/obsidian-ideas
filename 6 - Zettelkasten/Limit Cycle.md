# Limit Cycle
A **limit cycle** is a closed [trajectory](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Trajectory "Trajectory") in phase space having the property that at least one other trajectory spirals into it either as time approaches infinity or as time approaches negative infinity.

*The physiological bases for the inverse relation between amplitude and frequency and most other properties of [[EEG]] are largely unknown, although physiologically based [[Dynamical Systems]] theories have provided several tentative explanations. For example, several salient properties of EEG are consistent with limit cycle modes* (Nunez and Srinivasan, Electric Fields of the Brain).
