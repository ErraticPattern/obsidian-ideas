## Mechanics of Signal Acquisition

The electrodes’ free electrons are affected by the electric fields created by the changing magnetic fields which are themselves created by the moving charges of the bioprocess to be recorded – a process called **magnetic induction**. These interactions will lead to electrical potential changes – voltage changes – which are the values recorded by the EEG.
