# CMS/DRL Reference

CMS/DRL refers to Common Mode Sense (CMS) active electrode and Driven Right Leg (DRL) passive electrode.

For example, Emotiv headsets use CMS (P3 or left mastoid for EPOC, left mastoid for Insight) as an absolute voltage reference. DRL (P4 or right mastoid for EPOC, left mastoid for Insight) is a feedback cancellation system to float the reference level on the common mode body potential. These levels are not recorded anywhere, and are not estimated. They are inherent in the measurement as a relative reference point.
