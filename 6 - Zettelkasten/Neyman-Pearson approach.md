# Neyman-Pearson approach
It is an approach created to provide a rational procedure of decision making. 
Constraints: 
1. The probability distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis has to be known. This requires auxiliary assumptions about the data (normality, equal variance, independence), which may be false. 
2. Under the alternative hypothesis, the probability of exceeding the critical value must be large. In other words, the test must be powerful.

# Notes
When its assumptions are met, a theoretical distribution for the null-hypothesis can be built and used to get a p-value for a particular test-statistic which comes from real data.

Assumptions:
+ [[Normality]]
+ [[Homoscedasticity]]
+ [[Statistical Independence]]
Note that permutation-based approaches drop the first 2 assumptions.
