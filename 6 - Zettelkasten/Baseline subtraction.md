# Baseline subtraction

# Notes
It is argued by [[Arnaud Delorme]] that subtracting the baseline in [[ERP]] analysis is wrong as it represents an outdated model from an era of limited computing power. The conclusion of this video essay is that baseline subtraction is not recommended but if it has to be used then it is better to use a longer baseline period.

Interestingly, he also argues baseline subtraction is incompatible with the underlying assumptions of [[ESI]]. This is because non-linearities are introduced in the data, becoming more severe the smaller the baseline period, since every channel gets subtracted a different value independently of the others. This cannot be physiological plausive as brain source activity contributes linearly to every [[electrode]]. The shortcoming of baseline subtraction has been proved for [[independent component analysis|ICA]] ([[groppeIdentifyingReliableIndependent2009]]).
