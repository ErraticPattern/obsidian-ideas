# Bioelectricity

The eighteenth century was a period of great activity and interest in the new discoveries about electricity in both the salons and laboratories of the time. Among the intriguing gadgets were electrostatic machines, the Leyden jar (the original capacitor) and the gold leaf electroscope (which detects static electricity).

The modern study of the electrical nature of nervous activity began with Luigi Galvani’s (1737–1798) demonstration that electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve in a severed frog’s leg resulted in contraction of the attached muscle. These findings sparked a fierce debate between Galvani and Alessandro Volta (1745–1827) concerning the source of the electricity that caused the legs to become ‘‘reanimated.’’
