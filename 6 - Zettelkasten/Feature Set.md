# Feature Set
A feature vector is a vector that stores the features for a particular observation in a specific order.  A feature set is a set of all the attributes that you're interested in, e.g. height and age.
The implicit assumption when using this terminology is that your data is _tabular_ -- somehow, you have chosen to represent it as a "flat", matrix-like format. But non-tabular data formats, like network graphs, video, audio, images, binary data sequences, ... these all require some amount of engineering to represent as feature vectors ([[#^2fea57|source]]).
