# Dura Imaging
+ Dura potentials require no a priori assumptions.
+ The accuracy of dura potential estimates is limited "only" by electrode density, noise, and accuracy of volume conductor model. 
+ Transcortical potentials seem to vary between $\pm 200 \textmu V$.

---
# Notes
Find a software to compute dura potentials.
