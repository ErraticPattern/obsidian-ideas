# Cortical Stimulation

Firstly used in order to map the brain areas with the associated behaviour. This was of importance for scientific investigation but also for neurosurgery since knowing what brain areas are responsible for motor control would allow for the removal of a tumour without any damage to these areas and therefore preventing paralysis. The pioneer in this area was Wilder Penfield.

**Electrocorticography (ECoG)**, also known as iEEG, is an invasive procedure in which the electrodes are usually implanted either in a subdural or epidural location. The electrodes can be set up in different types of stimuli, width, amplitude, and frequency.

ECoG has a much better spatial resolution than EEG. This technique has some limitations such as provoking aberrant cellular activity, having a bias in signal interpretation due to spread of current and provoking haemodynamic changes in other regions. The signal is also more complex than EEG. ECoG doesn’t get more information than EEG but it records other type of information (more detailed but less global).

Nonetheless, it has uses beyond clinical settings such as mapping of other brain regions besides motor ones, as was done historically. ECoG has been used for studying both the sensory and motor homunculus. Findings suggest that motor areas encode specific complex movements, such as the one taking the hand to the mouth, instead of simple movement representation.

One study showed that stimulating the right inferior parietal regions triggered a strong intention and desire to move the contralateral hand, arm, or foot, whereas stimulating the left inferior parietal region provoked the intention to move the lips and to talk. When stimulation intensity was increased in parietal areas, participants believed they had really performed these movements, although no electromyographic activity was detected. Stimulation of the premotor region triggered overt mouth and contralateral limb movements. Yet, patients firmly denied that they had moved. Conscious intention and motor awareness thus arise from increased parietal activity before movement execution (Desmurget et al., 2009).

Other types of cortical stimulation include **cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP)** which can be used to visualize functional networks by applying direct cortical stimulation. This stimulation will then result in an evoked potential in other brain areas, showing connectivity.

Figure 129. Schematic illustration of presumed connections between the anterior and posterior language areas. The grey circle denotes the site of stimulation. Arrows indicate the direction of impulse projection evoked by single pulse stimulation. The excited fibres are shown as thick black lines, and those not excited as thin grey lines. Waveforms show representative CCEPs. AL = anterior language area; PL = posterior language area (Matsumoto et al., 2004).

**Single-neuron stimulation** is another technique to be used in research context.
