# Frontal alpha asymmetry
## Definition
FAA was derived by subtracting the logarithmic alpha power at electrode F4 (right frontal hemisphere) from F4 (left frontal hemisphere), i.e. F4â€“F3. ([[mavrosMobileEEGStudy2022]])
## Associations
+ Positive affect/[[Approach motivation]]
## Interpretation
+ More FAA is associate with approach motivation. For example, [[mavrosMobileEEGStudy2022]] showed that there is higher FAA for outdoor spaces in relation to indoor ones, suggesting an impetus to engage in *movement*.
>[!quote]
>This suggests that the either physical activity or providing a context of walking may shift the affective processing of environments.
