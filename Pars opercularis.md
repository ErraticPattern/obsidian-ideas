# BA 44 (pars opercularis)

Brodmann area 44 (BA 44), also known as **pars opercularis** (of the inferior frontal gyrus), is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Situated just anterior to premotor cortex (BA6) and on the lateral surface, inferior to BA9. It refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. It is associated with **syntax**.
