## Introduction

Computational neuroscience formalizes the biological structures and mechanisms of the nervous system in terms of information processing. Marr’s levels of analysis were first introduced in his book Vision and represent levels in which a system such as the brain can be described.

Originally introduced to advance the understanding of vision, Marr’s approach postulated three distinct ways (computational, algorithmic, implementational) to consider information processing in the context of neuroscience. This distinction has since been used in research across other cognitive domains (e.g., memory, attention, learning), though many have not strictly adopted the classically rigid framework of Marr’s hierarchy. Instead, the hierarchy is most commonly used as an organizing principle to highlight distinct conceptual questions at different levels of analysis.

Some famous computational models include Lapicque’s integrate-and fire model, which provides a simple model of neuronal changes in voltage and activity; the Hodgkin–Huxley model of action potential generation and propagation, which provides a detailed description of the dynamics of sodium and potassium channels in the initiation of the action potential; Rall’s cable theory, which provides a description of how the neuronal voltage relates to various morphological properties of neuronal processes (e.g., axons and dendrites); and Hebb’s plasticity rules, which provide an algorithm to update the strength of neuronal connections within neural networks (e.g., the synaptic plasticity, as a consequence of learning).
