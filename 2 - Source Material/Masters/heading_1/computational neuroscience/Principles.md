### Free Energy Principle

Informally put, free energy is the difference between the brain’s predictions about the world and the actual information it receives. More crucially, the free energy principle states that everything the brain does can be seen as an attempt to minimize free energy, i.e. to make the brain’s predictions align as much with possible with reality.
