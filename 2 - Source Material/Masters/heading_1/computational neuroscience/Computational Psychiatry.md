## Computational Psychiatry

Simply defined, computational psychiatry consists of applying computational modelling and theoretical approaches to psychiatric questions. Computational approaches to psychiatric disorders can be divided in data-driven models and theory-driven approaches; both can be complemented. The first relies on machine learning techniques to find patterns in unanalysed raw data as represented below. A clear advantage is that statistical analysis allows for a more precise description of a disease, additionally to the phenotypical criteria observed by humans.

Figure 175. Data-driven computational psychiatry. A hypothetical example illustrates how a data-driven approach might lead to new descriptions and classifications, beyond traditional, symptom-based categories of mental disorder. Consider a population of patients suffering from different types of mood disorders and for whom a variety of data has been collected (genetic, brain, physiological data, etc.). New clusters might be found in the data that might connect more directly with mechanisms underlying their symptoms. Such clusters might form groups that are more homogeneous than the original classification, and possibly more relevant in terms of possible treatment.

The second approach involves the use of mathematical models that relate several parameters with the goal of describing some phenomena and are based on previous corroborated theories of some particular topic (e.g., decision-making as represented in the figure below).

Figure 176. Basic computations involved in making a choice. Value-based decision making can be broken down into five basic processes: first, the construction of a representation of the decision problem, which entails identifying internal and external states as well as potential courses of action; second, the valuation of the different actions under consideration; third, the selection of one of the actions on the basis of their valuations; fourth, after implementing the decision the brain needs to measure the desirability of the outcomes that follow; and finally, the outcome evaluation is used to update the other processes to improve the quality of future decisions(Rangel et al., 2008).
