## Methodology

The earliest models that aimed at explaining mental computations and disorders are known as “connectionist” models. Donald Hebb introduced the term “**connectionism**” in the 1940s to describe a set of approaches that models mental or behavioural phenomena as emergent processes in interconnected networks of simple units – neural networks.

Types of neural networks include:

- Hopfield network
