This refers to the plasticity of synaptic plasticity. It can affect plasticity before, during or after induction. Additionally, it can be homosynaptic or heterosynaptic. One of the most studied components of homosynaptic metaplasticity are the mGluRs â€“ class I activates PKC and classes II/III inhibit cAMP. It was shown mGluRs were sometimes necessary for the induction of LTP, depending on the synapse history. Primarily, mGluR-primed synapses necessitate _de novo_ protein synthesis, dependent on PKC. This mechanism could induce LTP in the case of a modest stimulus in which the activation of only NMDARs may not be sufficient. It could be that these mGluRs (type I) are present in pathways in which learning is essential; furthermore, it might be a mechanism which accounts for the formation of circuits, especially in the so-called critical periods.

Heterosynaptic metaplasticity has an important role for the saliency between which information should be encoded in the neurons, based off its importance. Monoamine neurotransmitters include serotonin and the catecholamines dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline are responsible for this mechanism. Therefore, the activation of the respective receptors might be crucial for the induction of LTP in a specific pathway (Noradrenaline has been shown to underlie PTSD cases). Dopamine seems to be crucial in the CA1 region (for LTP2 induction) and NA in the DG region. Other type of heterosynaptic metaplasticity involves the induction of LTD at GABAergic neurons, by the retrograde signalling of eCBs. This induction of LTD will facilitate the induction of LTP at a neighbour glutamatergic neuron.
