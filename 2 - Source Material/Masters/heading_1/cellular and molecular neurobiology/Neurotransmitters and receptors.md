## Neurotransmitters and receptors

### Neurotransmitters

These can be divided by chemical classes:

- Small molecules
- Peptide neurotransmitters
- Atypical neurotransmitters (not sorted into vesicles)

#### Acetylcholine

**![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 105.png>)**

#### Glutamate

The EAAT transporters utilize the sodium and potassium gradient for the transportation of glutamate back to the cell. This function can be impaired in cases of stroke, and the gradient might be reversed leading to excessive synaptic glutamate over activating the respective receptors, resulting in excitotoxicity due to increase of intracellular calcium.

#### GABA and Glycine

Transporters: GAT1-4 (neurons and glia) – for GABA; GlyT1-2 (neurons and glia) – for glycine.

#### Catecholamines

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 108.png>)

Transport into vesicles of monoamines is done by the transporter (VMAT)-2. Cocaine can block this transporter, leading to higher synaptic dopamine or noradrenaline. Methamphetamines bock the DAT transporters (for dopamine) and NET transporters (for noradrenaline), leading to the same effect.

#### Serotonin (5-HT)

It suffers reuptake into the cell by SERT. Many antidepressant drugs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that inhibit transport of 5-HT by SERT. Furthermore, they get sorted in vesicles due to VAT.

Serotonin is modulated by several psychedelics.

#### Histamine

In the CNS, histamine is exclusively made by neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) in the posterior hypothalamus. These neurons project widely throughout the brain and spinal cord where they modulate arousal, attention, feeding behavior, and memory. There are four histamine receptors (H1 to H4), all of which are metabotropic. Centrally acting antihistamines are generally used for their sedative properties, and antagonism of H1 receptors is a common side effect of many drugs including some tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics.

#### Nitrous Oxide

The CNS contains a substantial amount of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) within certain classes of neurons. This neuronal NOS is an enzyme activated by calcium-calmodulin, and activation of NMDA receptors, which increases intracellular calcium, results in the generation of nitric oxide. Although a physiologic role for nitric oxide has been clearly established for vascular smooth muscle, its role in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity remains controversial. Nitric oxide diffuses freely across membranes and thus has been hypothesized to be a retrograde messenger, although this has not been demonstrated conclusively. Perhaps the strongest case for a role of nitric oxide in neuronal signalling in the CNS is for long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the cerebellum.

#### ATP (cotransmitter)

Excitatory function and comes from ADP. It is also a gliotransmitter. It creates the calcium waves in astrocytes.

##[[Gliotransmitters]]

### Neuropeptides

A great many CNS peptides have been discovered that produce dramatic effects both on animal behavior and on the activity of individual neurons. In many cases, peptide hormones discovered in the periphery also act as neurotransmitters in the CNS. As most of these peptides were initially named based on their peripheral functions, the names are often unrelated to their CNS function. The pathways for many of the peptides have been mapped with immunohistochemical techniques and include opioid peptides (e.g., enkephalins, endorphins), neurotensin, substance P, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone.

#### Opioids

The term opioid describes all compounds that work at opioid receptors. The term opiate specifically describes the naturally occurring alkaloids: morphine, codeine, thebaine, and papaverine. In contrast, narcotic was originally used to describe sleep-inducing medications, but in the United States, its usage has shifted into a legal term.

Opioid alkaloids (e.g., morphine) produce analgesia through actions at central nervous system (CNS) receptors that also respond to certain endogenous peptides with opioid-like pharmacologic properties. The general term currently used for these endogenous substances is endogenous opioid peptides. Three families of endogenous opioid peptides have been described: the **endorphins**, the **pentapeptide enkephalins** (methionine-enkephalin [metenkephalin] and leucine-enkephalin [leu-enkephalin]), and the **dynorphins**. These three families of endogenous opioid peptides have overlapping affinities for opioid receptors

- Dynorphin

It activates the NAcc and VTA.

#### Orexins

- Orexin A
- Orexin B

Orexins are peptide neurotransmitters produced in neurons in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus that, like the monoamine systems, project widely throughout the CNS. Orexins are also called hypocretins due to the near simultaneous discovery by two independent laboratories. Like most neuropeptides, orexin is released from large, dense core vesicles and bind to two G protein-coupled receptors. Orexin neurons also release glutamate and are thus excitatory. The orexin system, like the monoamine systems, projects widely throughout the CNS to influence physiology and behavior. In particular, orexin neurons exhibit firing patterns associated with wakefulness and project to and activate monoamine and acetylcholine neurons involved in sleep-wake. Animals lacking orexin or its receptors have narcolepsy and disrupted sleep-wake patterns. In addition to promoting wakefulness, the orexin system is involved in energy homeostasis, feeding behaviors, autonomic function, and reward.

#### Tachykinins

- Substance P

Substance P is contained in and released from small unmyelinated primary sensory neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem and causes a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential in target neurons. These sensory fibers are known to transmit noxious stimuli, and it is therefore surprising that—although substance P receptor antagonists can modify responses to certain types of pain—they do not block the response. Glutamate, which is released with substance P from these synapses, presumably plays an important role in transmitting pain stimuli. Substance P is certainly involved in many other functions because it is found in many areas of the CNS that are unrelated to pain pathways.

### Classic Neuromodulators

These activate heteroreceptors. These can modulate mechanisms of exocytosis, neurotransmitter receptor activity and neurotransmitter inactivation. «

#### Adenosine (ADO) and ATP

ADO is a homeostatic endogenous molecule and antiepileptic. Nucleotides are incorporated in vesicles by the vNUT transporter.

#### Endocannabinoids

Examples:

- 2-AG
- Anandamide (ANA)

eCB synthesis mostly results from cleavage of postsynaptic membrane lipids as a consequence of the activation of postsynaptic G-coupled glutamate metabotropic receptors (class I), which are predominantly activated as a consequence of high rate of neuronal firing. This activation will lead to activation of lipases which will cleave phospholipids and form eCBs. eCBs thus travel in a retrograde manner to activate astrocytic and nerve-terminal located CB1R, resulting in inhibition of neurotransmitter release, and giving rise to several forms of short-term synaptic plasticity (Silva-Cruz et al., 2017).

### Receptors

#### ADO receptors ([[#^footnote-38|Comment Unknown Author 38]])

Two high affinity adenosine receptor subtypes:

**A1R** –Inhibitory (Gi/Go coupled)

**A2AR** –Excitatory (Gs coupled); up-regulated in AD’s. Its activation is involved with glutamate release. This leads to a shift from LTD to LTP and consequences related co calcium dysregulation.![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 116.png>)

**A2BR**- Excitatory (Gs coupled)

**A3**- Inhibitory (Gi/Go coupled)

Caffeine is an antagonist of these receptors.

- ATP receptors

**P2X** – ionotropic for cations.

**P2Y** – metabotropic (Gq)

#### Endocannabinoids (eCBs) ([[#^footnote-39|Comment Unknown Author 39]])

**CB1R -** widely expressed in the brain including in areas responsible for mood control, reward, and memory. Expressed both in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and astrocytes. Considering the neuronal compartment only, it has been estimated that about three quarters of all CB1R present in hippocampi are on GABAergic neurons while glutamatergic neurons contain about one quarter of all hippocampal CB1R.

**CB2R –** more related to the immune system.

##[[Metabotropic receptors]]

##[[Ionotropic receptors (ligand-gated channels)]] 

### Ion Channels

Follow the electrochemical gradient depending on it, like the ionotropic receptors.

#### Voltage-gated ion channels

- Sodium

Opens at around -40 mV. Voltage-gated sodium channels have two gates: an activating gate that is voltage-dependent and an inactivating gate that is time-dependent. The opening of the activating gate allows the influx of sodium and cell depolarization. The closing of the inactivation gate will stop the flow of sodium regardless of the status of the activation gate. These two gates work in tandem to ensure that depolarization occurs in a controlled manner: after being open for a few milliseconds, the voltage-gated sodium channels will inactivate, stopping the flow of sodium, even in the presence of persistent stimulation. The channel will remain unable to open again until the cell repolarizes to a threshold voltage that varies depending on the cell type.

Channel pore is blocked by TTX. 

- Potassium (4 subunits)

Opens at around -55 mV. It has a function of controlling the membrane potential, due to its effect of repolarization. Seems to function as an inhibitor of noise - decrease signal to noise ration. It has a slower activation and inactivation time.

It is blocked by TEA.

- Calcium

Family 2 is more important for the release of neurotransmitter.

#### Resting channels (voltage insensitive)

- Potassium resting channels
- Calcium-activated potassium channel

### Intracellular signalling effector molecules

#### G protein-coupled receptors

Can either be homomeric or heteromeric. Have 7 transmembrane domains. The γβ subunit is identical across these receptors; it also has an effector function by binding to potassium channels and increasing its permeability.

Heteromeric G protein-coupled receptors (α subunit):

- Gq
- Gs
- Gi /Go

#### Second messengers

- Ca ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]])

Intracellular calcium concentration needs to be tightly regulated. Below are represented some channels which regulate it. SOCs are positive-feedback Ca ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) channels which open when calcium inside the endoplasmatic reticulum is released into the cytosol. NCX has low affinity but high capacity while the PMCA has high affinity but saturates easily. Furthermore, NCX can reverse the direction of the ion flux depending on the intracellular concentration of sodium. 

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 122.png>)

The EF-hand motif is the most common calcium-binding motif found in hundreds of proteins. The EF-hand consists of two alpha helices linked by a short loop region (usually about 12 amino acids) that usually binds calcium ions. Upon calcium binding, there is a conformational change of the structure, allowing for the calcium-dependent catalytic activity of the protein.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 123.png>)

- cAMP

It is converted to 5’-AMP by phosphodiesterase. Caffeine increases intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzymes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. These actions promote lipolysis via the activation of hormone-sensitive lipases with the release of free fatty acids and glycerol. The increased availability of these fuels in skeletal muscle acts to spare the consumption of muscle glycogen. Increased cAMP could also lead to an increase in blood catecholamines. However, caffeine is a fairly weak inhibitor of phosphodiesterase enzymes, and the in vivo concentrations at which behavioral effects occur are probably too low to be associated with meaningful phosphodiesterase inhibition.

#### Kinases

- Protein Kinase C (PKC)
- Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK); e.g. CaMKII
- Protein Kinase A (PKA)
- Tropomyosin/Tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk); e.g. TrkB

#### Phosphatases

#### Chaperones

- S100B

It constitutes 0.5% of all brain proteins. It binds to calcium and forms homodimers. Despite its neurotrophic effects at nanomolar concentrations, S100B has detrimental consequences under pathological conditions, including glial activation, enhanced inflammation and oligodendrogenesis impairment that hampers possible remyelination; it can also act as a DAMP.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 125.png>)Additionally, S100B has several functions. Some include its role in calcium homeostasis, interactions with p53 and it also functions as a marker of cell proliferation.
