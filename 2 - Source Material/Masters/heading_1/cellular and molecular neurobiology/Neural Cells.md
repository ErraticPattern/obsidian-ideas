### Neuron

On average, there are around 86 billion neurons in the human brain. The size of the neuron body is roughly of 100 µm. There are a thousand times more synapses than neurons. Its usual structure is represented below. The size of the axon is very variable and the biggest one in the huma as approximately 1 meter. In the blue whale, there might be axons with 30 meters.

Neurons can be divided by the number of processes that originate from the soma:

Neurons can also be divided by their function:

**Molecular markers**

For mature neurons – NeuN; βIII-tubulin.

For immature neurons – doublecortin (DCX).

For proliferating neurons - Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU); Ki67 (for SVZ NSCs).

For Purkinje cells – calbindin (CB).

### Glial Cells

These exist in the CNS and PNS. In total, there are roughly as many glial cells as neurons. Overall, glial cells support neuronal function in many aspects. All glial cells in addition with neurons contribute to the maintenance of the BBB – forming the neurovascular unit.

Glial cells only have passive membrane currents, when stimulated, contrarily to neurons. This happens because glial cells are sensitive to neurotransmitters since these express several of its receptors. The effect of these membrane currents influences cell physiology.

### Central Nervous system

**Astrocytes**

Usually exhibit astrocytes express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and exhibit striking differences in morphology, pharmacology, and physiology. These can be divided by the area in which they are found: Protoplasmic astrocytes – present in grey matter; Fibrous astrocytes (express more GFAP) – present in white matter; Bergmann glia and Velate astrocyte – present in cerebellum.

Astrocytes have several functions:

Provide with metabolic support like oligodendrocytes, by the provision of lactate and pyruvate to the neuron, through transporters.

It regulates the synaptic activity. In glutamatergic synapses astrocytes reuptakes glutamate and there it follows the glutamate/glutamine shuttle, which prevents excitotoxicity; glutamine synthetase is exclusively expressed in astrocytes. Additionally, astrocytes control GABA levels at the synaptic cleft, due to the activity of neuromodulators such as ATP, BDNF and ADO. Furthermore, GABA transaminase inhibitors are potential therapies for epilepsy.

Additionally, due to its wide expression of receptors, there is an intracellular change after binding of the neurotransmitter, which in turn results in the release of gliotransmitters and neuromodulators, and other molecules like serine, which has been implicated in synchronicity of theta activity between hippocampus and PFC. Calcium is one of the most important second messenger involved in these responses, which can, for example, be activated by P2Y receptors and mGluRs. IP3, generated by the active phospholipase C pathway or mechanical stimulation, would diffuse to nearby glia through gap junctions, release calcium from their internal stores. The release of ATP, which can cause further generation o IP3 and release of ATP of nearby cells, could explain longer signalling. Astrocytes exhibit a form of communication based on intra-and intercellular calcium (Ca2+) changes which regulate the production and/or secretion of several modulators of synaptic transmission, including growth factors, cytokines and chemical transmitters. The communication by calcium is known to upregulate the reuptake of GABA, and to be involved in LTP mechanisms.

**Microglia**

Comprise up to 20% of the total glial cells and has a daily local self-renewal of 0.08-2%. Originate from the haematopoietic cell line – extra-embryonic yolk sac-derived myeloid precursor which constitute the extraembryonic mesoderm; due to this fact, it has a much higher rate of self-renewal when compared to cells from neuronal precursor line (faster than neurogenesis). It has a resting state (M0) and reactive states – an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) and an activated pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1); this is simply a simplification since there is a spectrum of phenotypes and use of morphology or gene/protein expression as a substitute for directly assessing cell function is usually not accurate and specific enough. Overall, the type of microglia depends on its state and location. Additionally, microglia might prove useful to the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases due to its specific phenotype for each. Microglia express cytokine receptors which bind to either pro- or anti-inflammatory molecules that are present in the medium and dictate the microglia’s phenotype. Furthermore, it also expresses adhesion molecules and neurotransmitter receptors. Overall, various signals coming from neurons and astrocytes, involving adhesion or diffusible molecules, control the state of microglia, depending if the surrounding neural cells are healthy or injured.

**Oligodendrocytes**

Each oligodendrocyte produces myelin and sheaths several axon segments, from different neurons, with it. The myelin basic protein (MBP) is necessary to keep the architecture and compactness of the myelin sheath.

The myelin sheathing is a process which continues into adulthood. It is dependent of activity-dependent communication with neurons and astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) which are abundant in the adult central nervous system, and have the capacity to regenerate oligodendrocytes and myelin, surround electrically silent neurons. When these are activated, neurotransmitters such as ATP (P2Y activation), GABA and glutamate, and release of cytokines from astrocytes promote maturation and myelin production, by inducing gene expression.

Oligodendrocytes also provide metabolic support to neurons by the transportation of fast energy converting substrates such as lactate and pyruvate.

**Ependymal cells**

The ependyma is a single layer of ciliated, cuboidal cells lining the cerebral ventricles. The choroid plexus is continuous with the ependyma but projects into the ventricles, where it covers thin blood vessels and forms a highly branched papillary structure. This is the site of cerebrospinal fluid formation (CSF), whose functions have already been mentioned.

### Peripheral Nervous system

**Schwann cells**

Sheath neurons with myelin in the peripheral nervous system. In myelinated axons, Schwann cells form the myelin sheath. One Schwann cell sheaths only one axon. The sheath is not continuous. Individual myelinating Schwann cells cover about 1 mm of an axon equating to about 1000 Schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon.

**Satellite cells**

Commonly called the astrocytes of the peripheral nervous system. These cells surround neuronal cell bodies in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system.
