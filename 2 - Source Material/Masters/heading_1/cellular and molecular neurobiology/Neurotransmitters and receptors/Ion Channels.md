# Ion Channels

Follow the electrochemical gradient depending on it, like the ionotropic receptors.

## Voltage-gated ion channels

- Sodium

Opens at around -40 mV. Voltage-gated sodium channels have two gates: an activating gate that is voltage-dependent and an inactivating gate that is time-dependent. The opening of the activating gate allows the influx of sodium and cell depolarization. The closing of the inactivation gate will stop the flow of sodium regardless of the status of the activation gate. These two gates work in tandem to ensure that depolarization occurs in a controlled manner: after being open for a few milliseconds, the voltage-gated sodium channels will inactivate, stopping the flow of sodium, even in the presence of persistent stimulation. The channel will remain unable to open again until the cell repolarizes to a threshold voltage that varies depending on the cell type.

Channel pore is blocked by TTX. 

- Potassium (4 subunits)

Opens at around -55 mV. It has a function of controlling the membrane potential, due to its effect of repolarization. Seems to function as an inhibitor of noise - decrease signal to noise ration. It has a slower activation and inactivation time.

It is blocked by TEA.

- Calcium

Family 2 is more important for the release of neurotransmitter.

## Resting channels (voltage insensitive)

- Potassium resting channels
- Calcium-activated potassium channel
