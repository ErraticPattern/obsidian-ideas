# Neurotransmitters

These can be divided by chemical classes:

- Small molecules
- Peptide neurotransmitters
- Atypical neurotransmitters (not sorted into vesicles)

## Acetylcholine

## Glutamate

The EAAT transporters utilize the sodium and potassium gradient for the transportation of glutamate back to the cell. This function can be impaired in cases of stroke, and the gradient might be reversed leading to excessive synaptic glutamate over activating the respective receptors, resulting in excitotoxicity due to increase of intracellular calcium.

## GABA and Glycine

Transporters: GAT1-4 (neurons and glia) – for GABA; GlyT1-2 (neurons and glia) – for glycine.

## Catecholamines

Transport into vesicles of monoamines is done by the transporter (VMAT)-2. Cocaine can block this transporter, leading to higher synaptic dopamine or noradrenaline. Methamphetamines bock the DAT transporters (for dopamine) and NET transporters (for noradrenaline), leading to the same effect.

## Serotonin (5-HT)

It suffers reuptake into the cell by SERT. Many antidepressant drugs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that inhibit transport of 5-HT by SERT. Furthermore, they get sorted in vesicles due to VAT.

Serotonin is modulated by several psychedelics.

## Histamine

In the CNS, histamine is exclusively made by neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) in the posterior hypothalamus. These neurons project widely throughout the brain and spinal cord where they modulate arousal, attention, feeding behavior, and memory. There are four histamine receptors (H1 to H4), all of which are metabotropic. Centrally acting antihistamines are generally used for their sedative properties, and antagonism of H1 receptors is a common side effect of many drugs including some tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics.

## Nitrous Oxide

The CNS contains a substantial amount of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) within certain classes of neurons. This neuronal NOS is an enzyme activated by calcium-calmodulin, and activation of NMDA receptors, which increases intracellular calcium, results in the generation of nitric oxide. Although a physiologic role for nitric oxide has been clearly established for vascular smooth muscle, its role in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity remains controversial. Nitric oxide diffuses freely across membranes and thus has been hypothesized to be a retrograde messenger, although this has not been demonstrated conclusively. Perhaps the strongest case for a role of nitric oxide in neuronal signalling in the CNS is for long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the cerebellum.

## ATP (cotransmitter)

Excitatory function and comes from ADP. It is also a gliotransmitter. It creates the calcium waves in astrocytes.
