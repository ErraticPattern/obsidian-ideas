Muscarinic receptors – involved in the parasympathetic nervous system but also present in the brain. Pre- and post- synaptic locality.

mGluRs - class I activates PKC and classes II/III inhibit cAMP. The first are mainly post-synaptic and latter are mainly pre-synaptic.

GABAB – present post- and pre- synaptically. It results in a slow IPSP.

Adrenergic – involved in sympathetic nervous system.

5-HT 1,2,4,5,6,7 – All can be present post-synaptically but only 5-HT1 are present pre-synaptically.
