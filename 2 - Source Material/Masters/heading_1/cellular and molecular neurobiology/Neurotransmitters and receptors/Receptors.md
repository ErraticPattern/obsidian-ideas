# Receptors

## ADO receptors ([[#^footnote-38|Comment Unknown Author 38]])

Two high affinity adenosine receptor subtypes:

**A1R** –Inhibitory (Gi/Go coupled)

**A2AR** –Excitatory (Gs coupled); up-regulated in AD’s. Its activation is involved with glutamate release. This leads to a shift from LTD to LTP and consequences related co calcium dysregulation.![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 116.png>)

**A2BR**- Excitatory (Gs coupled)

**A3**- Inhibitory (Gi/Go coupled)

Caffeine is an antagonist of these receptors.

- ATP receptors

**P2X** – ionotropic for cations.

**P2Y** – metabotropic (Gq)

## Endocannabinoids (eCBs) ([[#^footnote-39|Comment Unknown Author 39]])

**CB1R -** widely expressed in the brain including in areas responsible for mood control, reward, and memory. Expressed both in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and astrocytes. Considering the neuronal compartment only, it has been estimated that about three quarters of all CB1R present in hippocampi are on GABAergic neurons while glutamatergic neurons contain about one quarter of all hippocampal CB1R.

**CB2R –** more related to the immune system.
