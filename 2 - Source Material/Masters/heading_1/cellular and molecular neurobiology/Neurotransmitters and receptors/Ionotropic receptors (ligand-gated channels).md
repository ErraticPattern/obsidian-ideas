nAChRs (5 subunits) - Only α and β subunits: 2(α4)3(β2) or 5(α7); the first are present in the brain and SNS ganglia and the second are present in the brain and are more permeable to calcium. nACh receptors are also present in the neuromuscular junction. α1-α9 subtypes cloned; 4 TM domains (TM1- TM4). β1-β4 subtypes cloned; 4 TM domains. α-subunit mostly important for ACh binding. TM2 mostly important for channel characteristics.

AMPARs (4 subunits) – Most receptors are symmetric dimers of 2GluA2 and 2GluA1. One glutamate binds to each subunit. GluA2 lacking are more permeable to calcium.

NMDARs (4 subunits) – More permeable to calcium are physiologically blocked by a magnesium ion in the resting neuron. It is activated by glutamate and glycine/serine; the magnesium ion leaves the pore at around -40 mV. Most NMDARs contain two obligate GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 subunits. During forebrain development, there is a shift in NMDAR subunit composition, from near-exclusively GluN2B-containing NMDARs to NMDARs containing a significant GluN2A contribution. GluN2B is more present extra-synaptically and is more permeable to calcium.

KainateRs – still not very studied. Similar to NMDARs.

GABAA (5 subunits) – 2 necessary α subunits (where GABA binds). Results in fast IPSPs. Tonic or phasic control depending on location; the former is extrasynaptically and have high affinity and low desensitization while the latter is synaptically and have low affinity and desensitize rapidly.

GlyRs – permeable to Cl ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]).

P2X receptors are membrane ion channels preferably permeable to sodium, potassium and calcium that open within milliseconds of the binding of ATP.
