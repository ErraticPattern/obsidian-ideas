# Classic Neuromodulators

These activate heteroreceptors. These can modulate mechanisms of exocytosis, neurotransmitter receptor activity and neurotransmitter inactivation. Â«

## Adenosine (ADO) and ATP

ADO is a homeostatic endogenous molecule and antiepileptic. Nucleotides are incorporated in vesicles by the vNUT transporter.

## Endocannabinoids

Examples:

- 2-AG
- Anandamide (ANA)

eCB synthesis mostly results from cleavage of postsynaptic membrane lipids as a consequence of the activation of postsynaptic G-coupled glutamate metabotropic receptors (class I), which are predominantly activated as a consequence of high rate of neuronal firing. This activation will lead to activation of lipases which will cleave phospholipids and form eCBs. eCBs thus travel in a retrograde manner to activate astrocytic and nerve-terminal located CB1R, resulting in inhibition of neurotransmitter release, and giving rise to several forms of short-term synaptic plasticity (Silva-Cruz et al., 2017).
