# Neuropeptides

A great many CNS peptides have been discovered that produce dramatic effects both on animal behavior and on the activity of individual neurons. In many cases, peptide hormones discovered in the periphery also act as neurotransmitters in the CNS. As most of these peptides were initially named based on their peripheral functions, the names are often unrelated to their CNS function. The pathways for many of the peptides have been mapped with immunohistochemical techniques and include opioid peptides (e.g., enkephalins, endorphins), neurotensin, substance P, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone.

## Opioids

The term opioid describes all compounds that work at opioid receptors. The term opiate specifically describes the naturally occurring alkaloids: morphine, codeine, thebaine, and papaverine. In contrast, narcotic was originally used to describe sleep-inducing medications, but in the United States, its usage has shifted into a legal term.

Opioid alkaloids (e.g., morphine) produce analgesia through actions at central nervous system (CNS) receptors that also respond to certain endogenous peptides with opioid-like pharmacologic properties. The general term currently used for these endogenous substances is endogenous opioid peptides. Three families of endogenous opioid peptides have been described: the **endorphins**, the **pentapeptide enkephalins** (methionine-enkephalin [metenkephalin] and leucine-enkephalin [leu-enkephalin]), and the **dynorphins**. These three families of endogenous opioid peptides have overlapping affinities for opioid receptors

- Dynorphin

It activates the NAcc and VTA.

## Orexins

- Orexin A
- Orexin B

Orexins are peptide neurotransmitters produced in neurons in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus that, like the monoamine systems, project widely throughout the CNS. Orexins are also called hypocretins due to the near simultaneous discovery by two independent laboratories. Like most neuropeptides, orexin is released from large, dense core vesicles and bind to two G protein-coupled receptors. Orexin neurons also release glutamate and are thus excitatory. The orexin system, like the monoamine systems, projects widely throughout the CNS to influence physiology and behavior. In particular, orexin neurons exhibit firing patterns associated with wakefulness and project to and activate monoamine and acetylcholine neurons involved in sleep-wake. Animals lacking orexin or its receptors have narcolepsy and disrupted sleep-wake patterns. In addition to promoting wakefulness, the orexin system is involved in energy homeostasis, feeding behaviors, autonomic function, and reward.

## Tachykinins

- Substance P

Substance P is contained in and released from small unmyelinated primary sensory neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem and causes a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential in target neurons. These sensory fibers are known to transmit noxious stimuli, and it is therefore surprising that—although substance P receptor antagonists can modify responses to certain types of pain—they do not block the response. Glutamate, which is released with substance P from these synapses, presumably plays an important role in transmitting pain stimuli. Substance P is certainly involved in many other functions because it is found in many areas of the CNS that are unrelated to pain pathways.
