## Potentials

### Equilibrium Potential

The equilibrium potential represents the voltage value recorded at which the chemical force acting on the ion (probabilistic) is equal and opposite to that of the electrical force acting on that same ion when there is a semi-permeable membrane between two compartments. Such is the case in a neuron, where the plasmatic membrane acts as a semi-permeable to ions. The equilibrium potential depends on the concentration of some specific ion, both inside and outside the cell.

These are the equilibrium potentials for each main ion:

The calculation of the equilibrium potential is given by the Nernst equation:

### Membrane Potential

The membrane potential of a cell at rest, the resting membrane potential (Vr), is equal to Vin since by convention the potential outside the cell is defined as zero (Vr = Vin – Vout). The membrane potential represents the voltage value of a neuron at rest, which is around -60 to -70 mv.

The calculation of the membrane potential is given by the Goldman equation, which involves the equilibrium potentials of all present ions, weighted by their conductance across the neuron at any given moment:

Since the concentration of ions stays relatively constant by the activity of ion pumps, and the movement of ions required to elicit an appreciable voltage change is not enough the change, significally, the concentrations of the ions, conductance is the parameter which will allow for the rapid difference of voltages necessary for the transmission of information.

### Action Potentials

The action potential happens as a result of an integration of synaptic potentials, if these reach the threshold potential (about 15 mV less negative than the resting membrane potential), at the soma, more specifically the axon initial segment (AIS) – a region rich with voltage-gated sodium channels. It can either happen or not and all action potentials are the same. Therefore, it is the frequency of evoked action potentials which give information about neural activity.

The action potential propagates by the changing of membrane potential across the axon, due to differences of the permeability to sodium and potassium; it has a duration of 2 ms. Furthermore, it only propagates in one direction due to the inactivation gate of the voltage-gated sodium channels, which inhibit the passage of ions in places where these channels were previously activated; this period of inactivation is called the absolute refractory period.

The insulation of the axon by myelin allows for the faster conduction of ions, due to more isolation of ions; the propagation is also faster the wider the axon diameter is. The myeline sheaths are intercalated by nodules of Ranvier which regenerate the action potential because if the entire surface of an axon were insulated, there would be no place for current to flow out of the axon, and action potentials could not be generated. Therefore, the action potential has a saltatory conduction.

Note: The passive current flow required for the regeneration of the action potential does not require the movement of Na+ along the axon but instead occurs by a shuttling of charge, somewhat similar to what happens when wires passively conduct electricity by transmission of electron charge. I think that by this is meant that as the Na+ increase in concentration inside the cell, negative charges will be attracted towards them, creating a local depolarization at the node of Ranvier, allowing for the regeneration of the action potential.

**Release of Neurotransmitter**

The action potential culminates in the activation of the voltage-gated calcium channels at the synaptic terminals. The increase of intracellular calcium will be responsible for the release of the neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles, resulting in an evoked synaptic potential.

### End Plate Potentials (EPP)

These are the analogs of synaptic potentials which occur at the neuromuscular junction, specifically at the motor endplate. There also exist miniature end-plate potentials. Release of acetylcholine by the motor neuron activates nAchRs. The resulting evoked change of membrane potential is called the end plate potential. When the EPP makes the cell voltage reach the threshold, an action potential is evoked, albeit a different one from neuronal action potentials; the former is longer in duration (15 ms).

### Synaptic Potentials

These can be evoked by an action potential or be spontaneous (mini synaptic potential). The latter reflect the synaptic potential evoked by the quantal release of neurotransmitter present in one synaptic vesicle, due to probabilistic events. The evoked synaptic potentials result in post-synaptic voltage differences which are multiples of the voltage differences evoked by one mini synaptic potential. This showed that a vesicle contains discrete amounts of neurotransmitter, whose value of quantum content can be calculated by a formula.

The nature of the synaptic potentials can be varied, representing analog information which will be transformed with digital information at the soma. These depend on the neurotransmitter, its quantity and, most importantly, the post-synaptic receptors. Synaptic potentials dissipate according to the distance from the synapse to the soma, although mechanisms such as spatial and temporal summation allow for the propagation of information to the soma.
