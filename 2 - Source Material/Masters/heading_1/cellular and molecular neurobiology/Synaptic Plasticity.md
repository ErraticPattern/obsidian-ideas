## Synaptic Plasticity

Synaptic plasticity specifically refers to the activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission at preexisting synapses. It is thought to play key roles in the consolidation of memory, early development of neural circuitry and evidence is accumulating that impairments in synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to several prominent neuropsychiatric disorders.

### Habituation and Sensitization

These terms of synaptic plasticity were first described in the invertebrate _Applysia párvula_. Habituation is a reduction of responsiveness after multiple application of the same stimulus. Habituation is discriminated from sensory adaptation and motor fatigue by its stimulus specificity, spontaneous recovery, dishabituation by a strong stimulus, and by a saving effect (stronger response decrement after multiple sessions of habituation). Sensitization is the increase of responsiveness after the experience of a strong stimulus (Menzel et al., 2007). Both of these phenomena can be either short-term or long-term and seem to be involved in mechanisms of attention.

### Short-term potentiation and depression (STP and STD)

It acts on the order of milliseconds to several minutes. These are thought to play important roles in short-term adaptations to sensory inputs, transient changes in behavioral states, and short-lasting forms of memory. Most forms of short-term synaptic plasticity are triggered by short bursts of activity causing a transient accumulation of calcium in presynaptic nerve terminals. This increase in presynaptic calcium in turn causes changes in the probability of neurotransmitter release by directly modifying the biochemical processes that underlie the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Paired-pulse facilitation or depression is a method for causing either STP or STD, depending on the time interval between the 2 stimuli and the history of synaptic activation. Because these forms of plasticity largely result from changes in the probability of transmitter release (p), synapses that begin with a very high p tend to depress their response to the second pulse. In contrast, synapses with a low initial p normally exhibit an increase in p in response to the second stimulus. Longer-lasting forms of plasticity are observed following repetitive or tetanic stimulation of synapses with prolonged (approximately 200 ms to 5 s) trains of stimulation applied at high frequencies (10–200 Hz). Augmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) describe an enhancement of transmitter release lasting from seconds (augmentation) to several minutes (PTP). These are still forms of short-term plasticity, whose mechanisms may be influenced not only neurotransmitter release but also by glial neurotransmitter reuptake, receptor desensitization and neuromodulation by glial and post-synaptic release of neuromodulators (Citri & Malenka, 2008).

In the mammalian brain, an important consequence of short-term synaptic plasticity is to influence the information processing function of synapses, enabling them to act as filters with a wide range of properties. For example, synapses with a low initial probability of release function as high-pass filters, since they will facilitate during high-frequency action potential bursts while low-frequency bursts will not be transmitted with the same efficacy. In contrast, synapses with a high initial probability of release function as low-pass filters, since they will depress during high-frequency bursts but will reliably relay low-frequency activity. The filtering characteristics of a synapse can be adjusted through modulation of the initial release probability (Citri & Malenka, 2008). Therefore it is a mechanisms which allows for the selectivity of information.

Decay of STP happens 2-40 minutes after stimulation when repetitive test stimuli are applied. In the absence of stimulation, potentiation can be maintained for hours. Therefore, STP is actually a form of LTP when no synaptic stimuli are given – activity shortens duration of potentiation. There are 2 types of STP: STP1 and STP2; STP1 has faster decay kinetics and involves activation of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs; STP2 involves activation of GluN2B- and GluN2D-containing NMDRs. Evidence suggests STP is most likely exclusively dependent on pre-synaptic mechanisms such as neurotransmitter release (Bliss et al., 2018).

### LTP (Long-term potentiation)

In hippocampus (due to extensively studied circuitry):

Hippocampus is thought to be responsible for memory formation of episodic-like memory (what, when, here). It is mainly excitatory. I would like to know how this circuitry would allow for such a memory formation, since it is usually studied due to its well-established circuitry.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 139.png>)Trisynaptic circuits of the hippocampal network. A diagram of the transversal section of the hippocampus shows the different subregions: DG, CA3, and CA1. The principle cells located in densely packed cell layers are synaptically connected via trisynaptic circuit". Mature and newborn granule cells receive their major synaptic input from the medial and lateral perforant path (MPP and LPP) that originates from the entorhinal cortex (EC) (1). Granule cells send their axons (mossy fibers) that terminate on the proximal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (2). CA3 pyramidal cells send axons (Schafer collateral axons) to CA1 pyramidal cells (3), whose axons in turn projects back to the EC. Inhibitory interneurons (such as basket cells) provide a dense network of GABAergic synaptic boutons within the granule cell layer and SGZ, innervating both mature and newborn granule cells. Hippocampal circuitry is subject to the regulation by various synaptic inputs: glutamate from EC, GABA from local interneurons, serotonin (5-HT) from dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), Ach (acetylcholine) from septal nucleus (SN), and dopamine from ventral tegmental area (VTA). NSC: neural stem cell; NPC: neural progenitor cell. (Song et al., 2012)

**Most studied type of LTP (CA1 region)**

It is dependent on the NMDA receptors. These open physiologically with binding of 1 glutamate and 1 serine or glycine. The pore of this ionotropic channel is usually blocked by a Mg ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) ion, therefore it requires temporal synchronicity between a post-synaptic depolarization and neurotransmitter release to open. These properties of NMDARs also explain the basic properties of LTP. Cooperativity and associativity occur because of the requirement for multiple synapses to be activated simultaneously to generate adequate postsynaptic depolarization to remove the magnesium block of the NMDAR. Input specificity is due to the compartmentalized increase in calcium, which is limited to the postsynaptic dendritic spine and does not influence adjacent spines. It is permeable to Na ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) and Ca ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) This is why high frequency stimulus (HFS) elicits LTP – due to assurance of the previous conditions and consequent opening of the NMDA channel. Furthermore, it has much slower opening and decay kinetics when compared to AMPARs. A theta burst maximally activates LTP, due to mechanisms involving GABA-B autoreceptors activation to depress GABA release (Bliss et al., 2018).

Figure 2 - Model of AMPAR trafficking during LTP and LTD. In the basal state (depicted on top), receptors cycle between the postsynaptic membrane and intracellular compartments. This is achieved through lateral mobility of the receptors out of the synapse into endocytic zones, where they are endocytosed into early endosomes in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner. Normally, the receptors are transferred to recycling endosomes and returned to the plasma membrane by exocytosis, followed by lateral movement into the synapse where they are retained through interaction with MAGUKs. Following induction of LTP, there is enhanced receptor exocytosis and stabilization at the synapse through a calcium-driven process that involves CAMKII and fusion of recycling endosomes mediated by Rab11a. Following the induction of LTD, enhanced endocytosis at extra synaptic sites occurs in a process that is calcium-dependent and involves protein phosphatases, primarily calcineurin and protein phosphatases 1 (PP1). While in the basal state endocytosis is presumably balanced by receptor recycling, following LTD receptors are retained within the cell, and perhaps degraded (Citri & Malenka, 2008).

**Phases of LTP**

**LTP1**

The first mechanisms responsible for LTP do not necessitate protein synthesis and include, in the post-synaptic neuron, the insertion of extra-synaptic AMPARs. They then can laterally diffuse in the plasma membrane and be trapped within the PSD due to their interactions with so-called ‘slot proteins’, which function to trap AMPARs and greatly reduce their lateral mobility. Furthermore, the addition of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation of AMPARs lead to a better permeability to ions, done by several kinases depending on the particular neuronal pathway. The most common kinases are PKA, PKC and CaMKII (this last one is a key component of NMDAR-dependent LTP). PKA is responsible for protein synthesis-dependent LTP and PKC, mainly an atypical isoform called PKMζ, maintains this long-term LTP by persistent phosphorylation. In the pre-synaptic neuron, there is higher release of neurotransmitter, which might be attributed to retrograde signalling of nitrous oxide (NO). There is also the recruitment of silent synapses.

**LTP2**

The long-term mechanisms of LTP (defined as the potentiation present more than 1–2 h after LTP induction) involve protein synthesis, either from translation of newly transcribed mRNAs in the soma or from already transcribed mRNAs present in the dendrites. The proteins involved in synaptic plasticity are the so called plasticity-related proteins (PRPs). The synaptic tagging and capture (STC) hypothesis claims these proteins are captured by use of a biochemical “tag”, which can be phosphorylation or other synaptic-associated tags. It might be that LTP-dependent protein synthesis and its tagging contribute to the plasticity of other weakly tetanized synapses. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are transcription factors immediately transcribed after induction which are necessary for long-lasting LTP. This phase of LTP also contributes to synaptogenesis, which is dependent on protein synthesis.

**LTP3 and occurrence between LTPs**

LTP3 is a transcription-dependent LTP, which remains largely unexplored. The difference between LTP1 and LTP2 is the timing of the stimulus. When a stimulus is given in a short-time space LTP1 occurs; however, if other HFS are given following a time-space of minutes, there is LTP2. This suggests the first stimulus primes the synapse for rapid-protein synthesis induction. This priming has been associated with the insertion of CP-AMPARs which are inserted extra-synaptically and then moved to the synapse, through a mechanism which involves NMDARs and PKA. The activation of dopamine receptors is also crucial for LTP2. Probably D1 family - Gs.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 142.png>) Multiple components of NMDAR-dependent LTP at Schaffer collateral-commissural synapses. A. The four phases of synaptic potentiation as originally defined by the Magdeburg group (adapted from Reymann & Frey, 2007). LTP1 is defined by sensitivity to kinase inhibitors (originally PKC inhibitors) but not protein synthesis inhibitors; LTP2 by sensitivity to translational but not transcriptional inhibitors and LTP3 by sensitivity to transcriptional inhibitors. If none of the four components is blocked a full, long-lasting LTP will be established (top black line). STP is largely resistant to these inhibitors. B, C. A revised terminology for the stages of LTP: B. The decay of STP is rapid during activation of the potentiated pathway. However, STP can be stored in latent form for many hours in the absence of activation and can therefore be considered a form of LTP (adapted from Volianskis and Jensen, 2003). C: A pairing protocol (top trace) selectively induces LTP1 (the pairing frequency is too low to induce STP). A compressed induction protocol (including a single tetanus) induces STP and LTP1; it is dependent on protein kinases, but independent of protein synthesis. The duration of LTP1 is variable; under certain conditions (e. g., a weak tetanus), LTP1 decays within an hour or so and is then commonly referred to as E-LTP (dashed line), but following stimulation with compressed trains or a single strong tetanus LTP1 can last for several hours. A spaced protocol triggers LTP2, a long-lasting potentiation that requires protein synthesis and is additive to LTP1. Note that it is induced very rapidly following the second induction stimulus when the inter-train interval is of the order of minutes. The total LTP induced by spaced protocols is commonly referred to as L-LTP (a composite of LTP1 and LTP2); the blue trace shows the residual potentiation (i. e., LTP1) achieved when spaced trains are given in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor. The arrow(s) depict the induction stimulus (e. g., high frequency stimulation or theta burst stimulation). Note that the relation between the E-LTP and L-LTP and the revised terminology of LTP1,2 and 3 presented here needs further investigation.(Bliss et al., 2018)

**Properties of LTP**

These properties relate to the proposed principles of Hebbian learning, which can be explained through the molecular mechanisms present in LTP induction. Associativity is a cellular analogue of classical conditioning and is an implicit property of the so called Hebbian synapse. Specificity dramatically increases the storage capacity of individual neurons since different synapses on the same cell can be involved in separate circuits encoding different bits of information.

**Other types of LTP induction**

LTP induction is majorly triggered by activation of NMDARs; however, other receptors are responsible for it, being involved in other different pathways. The mossy fiber pathway utilizes the activation of mGluRs (class I). In the spinal cord, some pathways utilize Ca ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]])-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), which lack the GluA2 subunit; these are also present at the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway, additionally to the NMDAR mechanism. Voltage-gated calcium channels or L-type calcium channels can also contribute to the induction of LTP.

**Presynaptic LTP**

Predominant in mossy fibers synapses. In contrast to NMDAR-dependent LTP, the triggering and expression of this form of LTP is thought to be solely or predominantly presynaptic, thus we refer to it as presynaptic LTP. While somewhat controversial, most experimental evidence suggests that presynaptic LTP is triggered by high frequency tetanic stimulation, which causes a large, activity dependent increase in calcium concentration within presynaptic axon terminals. Results from pharmacological manipulations and knockout mice are all consistent with the hypothesis that the increase in presynaptic calcium activates a calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase. This leads to an increase in presynaptic cAMP and activation of PKA, which phosphorylates critical presynaptic substrates to cause a long-lasting enhancement in transmitter release.

**LTP and learning**

Inhibition of NMDARs by the competitive antagonist AP5 (APV) resulted in impairment of spacial learning (a task associated with hippocampal activity). It was also shown that inhibition of NMDARs had no effect on memory retrieval. LTP, seems to me, a priming mechanism; it is a mechanism which enhances a certain circuit to be activated. If one synapse is potentiated then the probability of that signal being propagated is higher, when activated; therefore, there is a priming between input and the correct output – potentiation phenomena allow for plasticity and learning, for it develops circuitry. Essentially, potentiated synapses rule over others since these can propagate the information more easily. This dominance can be destroyed and depends solely on correlation between experiences. If the hippocampus is the gateway to long-term memory formation, then LTP must be a transient phenomenon in it, to allow for flexibility in memory formation; that most likely sis the function of LTD. Perhaps a study in which LTD is blocked in the hippocampus would confirm this hypothesis.

The synaptic plasticity and memory (SPM) hypothesis has been supported by studies using techniques resulting in the “saturation” of LTP. The metaplastic inhibition of LTP by NMDAR activation has been shown to contribute to apparent “saturation” of LTP by repeated induction episodes. Experimentally, saturation is defined as the state when additional HFS trains produce no further LTP. It has been shown that saturation leads to impaired new memory encoding and impaired accuracy of memory retrieval.

Some technologies to analyse how memory is encoded are very promising, such as the use of rhodopsin-activated cells which allow for the activation of certain memories encoded in groups of cells at will. These studies hint that potentiation mechanisms cannot solely be responsible for memory maintenance. Others think memories might be encoded in synapses instead of groups of cells.

See more of LTP in this study (Bliss et al., 2018).

### Mechanisms related to LTP

CB1R agonists impair cognition and prevent long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission; however, it can also facilitate LTP, depending on the pattern of neuronal firing that induces plasticity. Data obtained in the CA1 region of the hippocampus allowed to suggest that eCBs, by activating the CB1R, act as a high pass filter, inhibiting LTP of low magnitude while facilitating robust LTP (θ-bursts were used in this study). Thus, eCBs likely reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of activity-dependent synaptic strengthening at the CA1 area of the hippocampus. However, continuous activation of CB1R with an exogenous agonist or overproduction of a non-prevalent eCB, anandamide, leads to inhibition of strongly induced LTP, although the effect vanishes over time (Silva-Cruz et al., 2017).

### Modulation and Metamodulation in potentiation

A common scenario is that in response to strong postsynaptic depolarization, dendrites release retrograde messengers that act through G protein- coupled receptors located on presynaptic terminals to influence neurotransmitter release. Retrograde messengers that have been identified in specific cell types include dopamine, dynorphin, glutamate, GABA, nitric oxide, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and oxytocin. These can be released by calcium-dependent vesicular fusion or non-vesicular transportation (Citri & Malenka, 2008).

The use of a specific antagonist of the A2A receptors can attenuate the effects that exogenous administration of CB1 receptor agonists have on LTP, in the hippocampus. Since these 2 receptors can form heterodimers, both pathways interact. Therefore, this is a case of metamodulation.

### LTD (Long-term depression)

It is also mostly dependent on NMDARs and mGluRs. It is induced by low-frequency stimuli (LFS) and it is called _de novo_ LTD if it occurs in the basal state. There is an equilibrium between the action of LTP and LTD in a synapse, whose regulation can be attributed to the intracellular levels of calcium, probably dependent on some threshold level of it.

**NMDA-dependent LTD**

The typical protocol for eliciting LTD involves prolonged repetitive low frequency stimulation (roughly 900 stimuli at 1 Hz). The predominant current hypothesis is that quantitative properties of the postsynaptic calcium signal within dendritic spines dictates whether LTP or LTD is triggered, with LTD requiring a modest increase in calcium. This modest increase of calcium involves activation of a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase cascade consisting of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (also known as protein phosphatase 2B), PP1, and a phosphoprotein termed inhibitor-1 which functions to inhibit PP1 until it is dephosphorylated by calcineurin. The activity of phosphatases will lead to endocytosis of AMPARs and its dephosphorization.

**Other types of LTD**

Various forms of mGluR LTD have been observed in many brain regions, most notably at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse. This so-called cerebellar LTD is elicited when parallel fibers are activated coincident with climbing fiber activation and has been suggested to be particularly important for certain forms of motor learning.

LTD mediated by eCBs has been reported not only in excitatory (a process present in hippocampus) but also inhibitory synapses. It is now well established that in a number of brain regions endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers that are released by postsynaptic cells in response to strong depolarization and/or activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (e.g., mGluRs and muscarinic receptors) and function to transiently inhibit transmitter release (for roughly 0.5–1 min) at either excitatory or inhibitory synapses via activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors.
