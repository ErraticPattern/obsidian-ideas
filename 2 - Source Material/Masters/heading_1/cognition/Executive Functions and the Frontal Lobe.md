## Executive Functions and the Frontal Lobe

The pre-frontal cortex (PFC) is composed of:

- Dorsolateral - establishes connections with association and somatosensitive areas, working memory, mental flexibility.
- Orbitofrontal - social behaviour, moral, emoticons, personality, rewards and punishments, decision-making.
- Ventromedial - connections with amygdala and other areas of the limbic system.
- Anterior cingulate - assessment of salience of emotional and motivational information.

Figure 195. Difference between frontal lobe functioning and executive functioning. Executive functioning refers to a family of top-down mental processes involved in the creation, supervision, regulation, execution, and adjustment of an adequate goal-oriented behaviour.

There are different kinds of inhibition. Working memory refers to the processes which allow for the retention and manipulation of information. Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability of changing perspectives spatially (e.g., “What would this look like if I viewed it from a different direction?”) or interpersonally (e.g., “Let me see if I can see this from your point of view”).
