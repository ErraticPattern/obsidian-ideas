## Neuroimaging and Cognition

A field in neuroscience that is based on the brain lesion paradigm and functional neuroimaging. In effect, it uses ideas from two main concepts in neuroscience: **Localizationism** (each brain region is responsible for a specific cognitive function) and **Associativism** (cognitive functions are a product of functional connectivity across brain regions).

**Voxel based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM)** is a localizationist-based technique that uses MRI to assess the degree of overlap in brain lesion in patients with a specific cognitive pathology (comparing them to controls). This approach is very susceptible to errors of type I (false positives) - needs to be corrected with FWER statistical procedures.

**Tractography** is a associativism-based approach that calculates the preferential movement of water molecules inside axons and from this parameter estimates the direction of the tracts and connectivity.

**Functional MRI** is another localizationist approach that measures the BOLD signal and brain activity in an indirect manner.

Interestingly, the BOLD signal can be used to assess **functional connectivity**. This is done by accepting the premise that similar functions have similar fluctuations in BOLD signal. This principle is maintained both in resting state and in task-related activity. Additionally, negative correlations between networks can also be assessed (this principle can also be used to assess brain lesions). Finally, this idea can be translated to EEG data as well.

Techniques that require analysis of functional data across many subjects need a good **group brain alignment model**. This can be achieved by first overlapping structural brain regions across subjects and then by functional alignment.
