# Two-streams hypothesis
The two-streams hypothesis is a model of the neural processing of [[Vision]] and [[Hearing]]. In fact, both streams emanating from the occipital (vision) and temporal (hearing) can be understood as analogous – it seems as if the two-streams for hearing are an adaptation of the streams for vision.

Figure 179. The dorsal stream (green) and ventral stream (purple) are shown for vision. They originate from a common source in the visual cortex.

Regions of interest in the ventral pathway include the parahippocampal (place area), fusiform (face area), and visual (word form area).

Lateral view of the anteroventral and posterodorsal auditory processing pathways, and anatomical connections between SMA and pre-SMA and inferior frontal, temporal and parietal areas. The main anatomical systems involved in sound processing are shown in color. Projecting from the primary auditory cortex into anterior temporal and inferior frontal areas, the anteroventral stream decodes meaning in sounds ('what'). The posterodorsal pathway supports sensorimotor and spatial processes ('how' and 'where'), and it projects posteriorly into inferior parietal, sensory, motor, and inferior frontal areas.
