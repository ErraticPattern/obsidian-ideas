## Memory

**Memory** can be defined as the ability to encode, retain, and recall information that is critical for the survival of living beings. It is not a unitary function since memory disturbances after brain damage do not affect function as a whole - Dissociations offer distinct classification models useful for experimental and clinical research/assessment.

Figure 189. Basic memory processes. Learning refers to the passage from encoding to retention – sensitive to medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions. Learning is assessed by the recall of successive presentation of the material. Memory refers to passage from retention to retrieval – sensitive to MTL and frontal lobe lesions. Memory is assessed by the amount of information that is retrieved after delays from initial presentation.

Memory can further be divided in short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). Two historically relevant patients – H.M. and K.F. - suffered in a inverse manner in STM (it was ok in H.M.) and LTM.

Figure 190. Interactions between STM and LTM.

**STM** holds and actively manipulates information (allows for complex processing); it can be assessed using verbal or linguistic information. Tests include digit span (saying sets of numbers in order and in its reverse order) and spatial span (for people with language dysfunction).

**LTM**, contrary to STM, is impaired in amnesia. Memory disturbances prompted the division of explicit (declarative) and implicit memory (non-declarative) types. Explicit memory is dependent on frontal lobe regions and the anterior temporal lobe.

**Autonoetic (self-knowing) consciousness** is consciousness that mediates an individual’s awareness of his/her existence and identity in subjective time extending from the personal past through the present and the personal future.

### Tests

The drawing the star and tower of Hanoi are tests for assessing implicit memory.

Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) tests declarative memory such as logical memory, verbal-paired associates (associative learning), and non-associative learning (done by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT ([[#^footnote-50|Comment Unknown Author 50]]))). Both immediate and with a 30-minute delay versions are performed.

For declarative memory there is also the visual reproduction test, the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure, face recognition. There is the Autobiographical Memory Inventory for autobiographical memory.

There are **considerations** to take. Sensory, motor, arousal/consciousness and attentional abilities are pre-requisites for the assessment of memory. There are specific factors: Individual (e.g. age, education, sex), Anatomical/etiological (e.g. Temporal vs frontal lesions, etc.), Material (e.g. verbal-visual). The assessment must include both recent and remote memory.

Information on memory must come from the patient, its familiars and on performed tests. There needs to be caution for **malingering**, in which memory deficits are faked. Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) assesses malingering.
