## Right Hemisphere Syndromes

**Neglect** is an inability to perceive, report and orient to sensory events towards one side of space, contralateral to the side of the lesion, with or without a primary sensory deficit.

[[Attention]] is a broad term that includes: 1) Sensory selection (filtering, focusing, automatic shifting); 2) Response selection (supervisory control); 3) Sustained performance (concentration). There seem to be 2 important networks regulating attention: the **[[ventral attention network]]** (VAN) and **[[dorsal attention network]]** (DAN).

The VAN is bilateral and therefore if one hemisphere is lesioned, the other one will be dominant and there will be neglect. The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) has 3 branches. The second branch of the SLF connects the VAN to the DAN. The pathology of the SLF is associated with neglect.

There can be several types of neglect depending on the frame of reference, which can be egocentric or allocentric (stimulus-centered or object-centered).

**Anosognosia** is a disorder in which a patient, affected by a brain dysfunction, does not recognize the presence or appreciate the severity of deficits in sensory, perceptual, motor, affective or cognitive functioning. Anosognosia and neglect can be evident in the same patient since they are both right-hemispherical disorders (although it is possible it is left-hemispherical).

Other syndromes such as **optic ataxia** (dorsal-dorsal stream) and **dressing apraxia** (ventral-dorsal stream) are involved with the disfunction of the dorsal pathway.

Syndromes such as associative **prosopagnosia** (inability to recognize faces) are associated with the ventral pathway.

**Spatial navigation** can also be affected, and it has different manifestations: Egocentric disorientation; Allocentric disorientation; Landmark agnosia; Anterograde disorientation.

Finally, there can also be **delusional misidentifications** which are persistent delusions of hyper- or hypo-familiarity for meaningful persons, body parts or places in one's environment.

**Reduplicative paramnesia** refers to the patientâ€™s belief that he is in a different place than the actual one, even in the face of compelling counterevidence. There are different types:

- Confabulatory mislocation: The patient believes he is in another place (usually in a familiar one).
- Reduplication: The patient believes that two places have been duplicated and exist simultaneously in different locations.
- Chimeric assimilation: The patient believes that two places were merged.

**Somatoparaphrenia** is a type of monothematic delusion where one denies ownership of a limb or an entire side of one's body, even when given clear evidence. Somatoparaphrenia differs from a similar disorder, **asomatognosia**, which is characterized as loss of recognition of half of the body or a limb, possibly due to paralysis or unilateral neglect; evidence is not rejected by patients in this case.
