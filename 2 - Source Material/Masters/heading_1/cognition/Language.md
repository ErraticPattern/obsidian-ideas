## Language

Language is the acoustic-articulatory code that allow us to represent and communicate objects, concepts, emotions, intentions, and actions. Language has different components such as phonology, lexicon, semantics, syntax, and metalinguistic aspects (prosody, irony, etc.).

Language tests’ scores are very robust against aging, contrary to other cognitive functions like memory and processing speed. Lexical retrieval tends to stay constant over time. There is however discourse change related to aging. Additionally, there might be more difficulty in recalling proper-names when older (more tip-of-the-tongue phenomena).

Most instances of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in relationship to language are about word finding difficulties, and to a lesser extent about proper name retrieval difficulties. Therefore, language complaints are indicators of pre-dementia.

### Anatomy

Pars Opercularis (BA44) is associated with syntax while BA45 is associated with semantics – both these areas combined result in **Broca’s area**. These areas seem to be connected with the dorsal stream (where pathway ([[#^footnote-48|Comment Unknown Author 48]])).

The left posterior superior temporal gyrus and adjacent supramarginal gyrus – present in **Wernicke’s area**. Recent evidence shows that this region is not critical for speech perception or for word comprehension. Rather, it supports retrieval of phonological forms (mental representations of phoneme sequences), which are used for speech output and short-term memory tasks. Focal damage to this region produces phonemic paraphasia without impairing word comprehension, i.e., conduction aphasia. Wernicke’s area seems to be responsible for spacing each word in speech comprehension.

Figure 186. Lichtheim introduced a ‘‘concept center’’ (denoted in B). Conduction aphasia is probably due to damage of the arcuate fasciculus which connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas). M is Broca’s area and A is Wernicke’s area.

This model lead to the discovery of other regions associated with language: supramarginal gyrus, (SMG), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), angular gyrus.

Figure 187. The classical Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind model of the neurobiology of language. In this model Broca's area is crucial for language production, Wernicke's area subserves language comprehension, and the necessary information exchange between these areas (such as in reading aloud) is done via the arcuate fasciculus, a major fiber bundle connecting the language areas in temporal cortex (Wernicke's area) and frontal cortex (Broca's area). The language areas are bordering one of the major fissures in the brain, the so-called Sylvian fissure. Collectively, this part of the brain is often referred to as perisylvian cortex.

### Pathology

Three main categories:

- Speech Production

Speech apraxia, Luria’s dynamic aphasia (mutism and loss of initiation ([[#^footnote-49|Comment Unknown Author 49]])), echolalia.

- Phonological
- Lexical-semantic
