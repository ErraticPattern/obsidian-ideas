### Neurotrophins and receptors

Neurotrophins are central to many facets of CNS function, from differentiation and neuronal survival to synaptogenesis, activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, cell survival, growth and cell death regulation. Neurotrophins can have a pre- or pro- form. The pro-neurotrophins can also have a biological effect on the respective receptors. Pro-neurotrophins have higher affinity for the p75 receptors. The p75 receptors can either result in cell survival or apoptosis. In the presence of TrkB, p75 receptors lead to cell survival, while in the contrary apoptosis is induced. Tyrosine kinase receptors can either be full-end or truncated; the truncated receptors modulate negatively the activity of the full-end receptors. Furthermore, TrkB receptors are important in astrocytes for calcium regulation; there exist only truncated TrkB receptors in astrocytes. For these reasons, neurotrophins activity stands as an equilibrium between pro-death and pro-survival mechanisms (Lu et al., 2005).

**NGF**

The binding of neurotrophins to the tyrosine kinase receptors cause these to dimerize, and the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of each receptor then phosphorylates its partner receptor. Phosphorylated Trk receptors trigger the ras cascade, resulting in the activation of multiple protein kinases, including MAPK. Some of these kinases translocate to the nucleus to activate transcriptional activators, such as CREB. This ras-based component of the NGF pathway is primarily responsible for inducing and maintaining differentiation of NGF-sensitive neurons. Phosphorylation of TrkA also causes this receptor to stimulate the activity of phospholipase C, which increases production of IP3 and DAG. IP3 induces release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, and DAG activates PKC. These two second messengers appear to target many of the same downstream effectors as ras. Finally, activation of TrkA receptors also causes activation of other protein kinases (such as Akt kinase) that inhibit cell death.

**BDNF**

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been recognized as a key regulator of synapse development and plasticity. This is because BDNF is the only neurotrophin indisputably secreted in an activity-dependent manner. Indeed, activity-dependent secretion of BDNF has been shown to be critical for hippocampus-dependent memory in human (Je et al., 2012). Pro-BDNF is converted to mature BDNF by plasmin and, extracellularly, by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Two molecules of BDNF are necessary to activate the TrkB receptor. As seen in the image below, the pathways BDNF activates overlap the ones of NGF.

Studies with mice have shown activation of A2A receptors upregulates the formation of BDNF. Paradoxically, caffeine, an antagonist of ADO receptors, leads to increase of cognition functions. It was postulated that overactivation of A2A receptors can lead to toxicity, giving caffeine the role of maintaining equilibrium. In Rett Syndrome, levels of BDNF and A2A receptors are low.
