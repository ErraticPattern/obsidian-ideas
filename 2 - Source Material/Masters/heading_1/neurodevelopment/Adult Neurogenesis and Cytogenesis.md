## Adult Neurogenesis and Cytogenesis

Neurogenesis refers to the creation of neurons, while cytogenesis refers to the creation of glial cells. Like the creation of any cell, it is dependent on stem cells, highly unspecialized and capable of self-renewal, which later differentiate into various cell types. The potency of each type of stem cell refers to the range of cell types it can differentiate into. Cells from the morula are totipotent, from the inner cell mass are pluripotent, called embryonic stem cells, and cells from each germinative layer are multipotent. It is also possible to induce any adult somatic cell type to become a stem cell again, by using the Yamanaka factors, creating the so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). It is also possible to directly transform one cell type into another differentiated cell type with use of specific factors, a process called transdifferentiation. Neurogenesis existence in the mammal adult brain is still debatable and there seems to be a decrease of neurogenesis in more complex animals which accompanies a diminishment of neural regeneration. One theory defends that this diminishing of the neural stem cell pool is a protective mechanism against the formation of cancer cells. I think that the higher the brain complexity, the more obsolete neurogenesis becomes since in the case of injury, a new neuron would not be able to travel into the necessary injured areas and adopt the necessary functions, which would lead to aberrant circuitry and activity.

In the human adult, there are only multipotent cell lines and only on specific organs: the bone marrow, the heart and the brain. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent stem cells which are present in the adult and give rise to all neural cells. These are present in the neurogenic niches: the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ). These also might also exist in the hypothalamus and striatum. The process of neurogenesis involves tangential migration which is necessary for differentiation and radial migration necessary for circuit integration. Both types of migrations depend on blood vessels and seem to occur over a period of 4 weeks. Neurons in the brain originate from a relatively small number of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Neural stem cells (NSCs) can be defined as cells that can generate all the cell types in the brain (from the neuroectoderm cell line), whereas neural progenitors (NPs) have more restricted potential (Homem et al., 2015). Neural progenitors include the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Division of these stem cells can either decrease its pool maintain or increase it, by having both symmetrical and asymmetrical modes of division.

**Neurogenesis in SVZ**

This type of neurogenesis can lead to formation of neurons, astrocytes but also of oligodendrocytes. Type B cells have slow division, protrude their processes into the ventricle and communicate with blood vessels. These can get activated into type C cells, which divide faster. Afterwards, these become the type C cells, or neuroblasts, which migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS), by way of blood vessels, to the olfactory bulb. Blood vessel proliferation is therefore associated with neural proliferation. SVZ neurogenesis seems to be very active in rodents since the olfactory bulb is highly developed and olfactory functions are crucial for them; however, in humans, the RMS degenerates 2 years after birth. It is known that SVZ neurogenesis in mice help in the fine discrimination of similar odours.

**Neurogenesis in SGZ**

SGZ neurogenesis can lead to formation of neurons and astrocytes and seems to play a bigger role in human adult neurogenesis, perhaps due to the high functional importance of the hippocampus in spatial and declarative memory. Some studies have shown that neurogenesis allows for discrimination of similar pattern separation, in terms of spatial information. However there is still not consensus in the scientific community to whether neurogenesis is prevalent in the hippocampus in the adult. It might be possible that new neurons are simply the result of maturation of immature neurons which have persisted for a long time in this state. How to devise a definite proof against and pro neurogenesis? In mice it is known that the neuronal milieu is fundamental for the process of neurogenesis, in addition to environmental factors.

**Neurogenesis in Pathologies**

Aberrant neurogenesis has been seen in stroke cases and in epilepsy. In neurodegenerative diseases, transplantation of NSCs might prove efficacious to attenuate symptoms, such as in PD. In MS, oligodendrogenesis activation might prove beneficial. This process is dependent on OPCs which comprise 3-8% of cells in the brain parenchyma and can also be derived from NSCs in pathology.

**Regulation of Neurogenesis**

Besides environmental and extrinsic factors, there are also intrinsic regulators of neurogenesis which include ADO, BDNF and eCBs. Rat studies have shown that CB1R and CB2R activation led to increased neurogenesis, while antagonizing either one has no effect on neurogenesis. This led to the postulation of heteromerization between both receptors. Furthermore, BDNF seems to interact with eCB receptors and it is necessary for neurogenesis. Summary of this interaction is represented in the image below. Furthermore, studies have also shown an association between ADO receptor A2A activation and increased activity of BDNF (see BDNF section for more information).
