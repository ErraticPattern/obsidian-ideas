## Neuroinflammation

Is defined as the complex biological response of body tissues to all harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. It aims at elimination of initial cause of cell injury and tissue repair. Sterile inflammation occurs in the absence of microorganisms and it is usually associated with the recognition of DAMPs. The receptors involved in this kind of inflammation are the RAGE receptors, to which the HMGB1 binds, and PRRs such as TLRs and NLRs.

### Blood Brain Barrier

It is composed of endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, the basal lamina, the glial cells and neurons – creating the neurovascular unit (NVU). It provides the brain an immunoprivileged environment due to the presence of tight junctions and adherens junctions at the endothelial cell. Furthermore, leukocyte adhesion molecules (LAMs) are express at very low levels to suppress immune surveillance in the brain.

Peripheral inflammation can disrupt the BBB by various mechanisms:

### Neuroinflammation-associated diseases

Neuroinflammation has been associated with sepsis and hyperbilirubinemia in neonates, ALS and AD. Bilirubin can cross the BBB and cause kernicterus, of which cognitive dysfunction is a symptom. Kernicterus affects myelination, increases reactive states of microglia and astrocytes and causes cerebellum atrophy. Additionally, neonatal peripheral inflammation causes neuroinflammation, which interferes with the normal development and maturation of microglia.

**In ALS**

Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are prevalent in fALS (15-30%). In mouse studies, both the miR-146a and miR-124 seem to be potential targets for the regulation of mutant SOD1.

### Reactive gliosis

Acute neuroinflammation has benefits, since the damage it causes in the process outweighs the damage caused by a harmful stimulus on its own. Microglia and astrocytes compose the immune cells which suffer reactive gliosis upon an injury, releasing neurotrophic factors, chemokines and cytokines. These signals are indeed necessary for the correct development of the nervous system; however, in chronic inflammation there is wide destruction of tissue due to the over production of DAMPs, leading to a positive feedback cycle of inflammation.

**Microgliosis**

In response to changes in local CNS microenvironment microglia become activated—microglia polarization — and evolve from a non-activated resting state (M0) to a reactive phenotype (M1/M2) – there is a spectrum of reactive phenotypes and therefore the M1/M2 notation is a simplification.

Nowadays, the prevalent view is that a particular microglia phenotype should be analysed based on various parameters such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, morphological and epigenetic.

**Astrogliosis**

Tile the entire CNS in a non-overlapping manner that is orderly and well organized. Express toll-like receptors (TLRs) which are PRRs and components of the complement system which are involved in innate immunity. Reactive astrogliosis leads to changes which include alterations in gene expression, cell hypertrophy, thickness of astrocytic processes and gradual loss of cellular domain. Different initiating CNS injuries elicit different types of reactive astrocytes: neuroinflammation promotes A1, while ischemic events stimulate A2. This nomenclature parallels that of the microglia.

### Cytokines and Chemokines

Cytokines are a class of proteins that regulate inflammation, cell signalling and various cellular processes such as growth and survival. Chemokines are a subset of these proteins which mediate cell migration. Cytokines and chemokines are expressed at a constitutive level by neurons and glia in physiological conditions but become upregulated like their respective receptors.

**IL-1 family**

It is a pleiotropic cytokine, which interacts with the IL-1 receptors. IL-1α and IL-1RA possess precursor forms of its proteins with biological activity, while IL-1β requires cleavage by caspase-1. However, IL-1β is capable of inducing its own expression and it is capable of creating a highly inflammatory environment in small concentrations.

**TNFα**

**IL-6**

It can be either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory depending on the receptor it activates.

**HMGB1/TLR4/RAGE axis**

HMGB1 is a non-histone nuclear protein but also has functions as an extracellular inflammatory cytokine, where it functions as an alarmin. It can activate the TLR4 and RAGE receptors.

**Inflammasomes**

NLRP3 has pro-caspase 1 bound to it. Therefore, this NLR is implicated in the mechanisms of pyroptosis, by activating caspase 1. This NLRP3 inflammasome might be a potential target for neurodegenerative diseases.
