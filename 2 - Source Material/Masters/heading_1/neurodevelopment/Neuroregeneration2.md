## Neuroregeneration

Loss of function due to injury can be compensated either by regeneration of injured axons, true neuroregeneration, or by the sprouting of preserved neurons. Neuroregeneration is therefore a mechanism of potential great value for several neurodegenerative diseases.

Humans have very limited regeneration overall when compared to other lower animals in the animal kingdom and the nervous tissue is one of the less regenerative tissues in the human body. In the adult, an injured neuron instead of forming a GC and create new synapses, it forms a retraction bulb. There occurs the so-called Wallerian degeneration which leads to degeneration of the structures distal to the site of injury.

### CNS vs PNS

However, there is a difference in the capability of neuronal regeneration of neurons in the CNS and PNS. While in the first there is no possible regeneration, in the PNS there is a partial regeneration. In the PNS, at the injury site, a calcium wave is created which will induce changes in chromatin conformation and, along with other injury signals, lead to the transcription of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) and its anterograde transport along with mitochondrias and other organelles. Furthermore, Wallerian degeneration in the PNS leads to the dedifferentiation of Schwann cells which facilitate debris phagocytosis by releasing macrophages chemokines. Later, Schwann cells re-differentiate and produce myelin and guide axonal regrowth. In the CNS, there is no calcium wave and inflammatory-associated cells like astrocytes and microglia release inhibitors of regeneration, providing a chemical barrier. Furthermore, there is also a physical barrier created by the glial scar, since oligodendrocytes do not stop producing myelin, astrocytes produce proteoglycans and fibroblasts stand at the injury site.
