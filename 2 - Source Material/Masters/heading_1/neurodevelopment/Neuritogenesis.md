## Neuritogenesis

Neuronal growth is first characterized by the loss of symmetry and cell polarization. This is possible due to the creation and probing of neurites, which is dependent on subjacent changes of microtubules, in the axon shaft, and actin filaments, in the lamellipodia and filopodia. The probing of neurites is done at the level of the growth cone (GC), where it can sense molecules (depending on the expressed receptors) which either attract it, the attractive cues, or repress it, the repressive cues. An important class of attractive cues are the neurotrophins, which lead to actin and tubulin polymerization and induce transcriptional changes which result in neurite growth; CAMs and ECM proteins help in the process of neurite migration so that it can from synapses. Some classes of repressive cues include the semaphorins, ephrins, nectrin and slits proteins. Repressive cues often depolarize the neuron since cations entry inhibit microtubule activity and therefore inhibit neurite growth.

### Microtubules

Check my notes of neurobiology. Microtubules provide a physical substrate for the migration of molecular motors, kinesins and dyneins, which carry molecular cargo necessary for the growth of neurons. Kinesis travel in the anterograde direction while dyneins travel in the retrograde direction.

Microtubules were found to be surrounded by periodic rings of actin in intervals of about 190 nm, which are connected by spectrin tetramers. While details in function and morphology are still largely unknown, it is possible that this structure allows the stretching of the axons which accompany the physical growth of the organism, which in humans occurs in the 5 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) month of gestation and in puberty, and which maintains the structure of it in abrupt movements.
