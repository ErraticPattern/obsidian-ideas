## Neurodegeneration

Physiological cell death is crucial for the correct development of an organism. It can be either regulated (RCD) or unregulated (NRCD/ACD) by certain molecules. The first is called apoptosis and the second is called necrosis. Inside the RCD class, there are other divisions of type of cell death based on the disruption of the membrane. This last class, like in necrosis, will lead to inflammatory processes due to the leaking of cellular components to the extracellular medium. All known types of cell death are summarized in the image below.

### Necrosis

It can occur because of illness, infection, injury, hypoxia or lack of blood flow. Intracellularly, high levels of ROS or Ca ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]), among other events, promote necrosis. It is characterized by swelling of the organelles and membrane disruption, in which there is release of alarmins leading to inflammation processes.

### Apoptosis

Characterized by chromatin condensation, shrinkage of the cell, membrane blebbing and partition of nucleus and cytoplasm into apoptotic bodies posteriorly digested by phagocytosis, without leading to inflammation processes. It can be induced by the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is capable of activating the intrinsic one.

### Autophagy

Autophagy is a process required for the removal of cell waste. LC3-1 is a marker of autophagy.

There are several types of autophagy represented in the image below. The KFERTQ motif is present in approximately 30% of all proteins.

### Necroptosis

It is a process which resembles both apoptosis and necrosis. It involves ligand binding to a death receptor and formation of the RIPK3-containing necrosome complex. The necrosome then promotes the phosphorylation and oligomerization of MLKL, that translocates to the plasma membrane, disrupts the membrane integrity and causes release of intracellular components. Necroptosis occurs only in the absence of caspase 8, which inhibits the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 by cleavage of both.

### Ferroptosis

Ferroptosis is a novel form of regulated cell death triggered by the excessive peroxidation of membrane phospholipids.

### Pyroptosis

Pyroptosis is an inflammatory type of cell death mediated by inflammatory caspases, such as Caspase1 and Caspases-4/5 (Caspase-11 in rodents). Activation of inflammatory caspases leads to Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, the executor of pyroptosis. Upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases GSDMD N-terminal migrates to plasma membrane, oligomerizes and forms pores. Mature IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory molecule, is also released.

If the membrane repair mechanisms are not able to overcome the GSDMD pore burden in the plasma membrane, the cell will die by pyroptosis. The non-canonical pathway leads to potassium efflux. This decrease of potassium intracellularly leads to the activation of the NLRP3, leading to he activation of inflammasome-mediated pathways.![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 195.png>)

Inflammasomes are intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that assemble in response to various Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs). There are several classes of PRRs such as the TLRs and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). Assembly of an inflammasome triggers proteolytic cleavage of inactive pro-caspase-1 into active caspase-1, which converts pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into mature and biologically active cytokines.

In conclusion, in necrotic-like and necrotic cell deaths, DAMPs are released (e.g. ROS and alarmins) leading to the activation of glial cells, making these reactive and causing damage to the tissue.
