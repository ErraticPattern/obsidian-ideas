## Autonomic Nervous system

### ANS Structure

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is largely independent (autonomous) in that its activities are not under direct conscious control. It is concerned primarily with control and integration of visceral functions necessary for life such as cardiac output, blood flow distribution, and digestion. Evidence is accumulating that the ANS, especially the Vagus nerve, also influences immune function and some CNS functions such as seizure discharge.

The vagus nerve represents the main component of the parasympathetic nervous system, which oversees a vast array of crucial bodily functions, including control of mood, immune response, digestion, and heart rate. It establishes one of the connections between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract and sends information about the state of the inner organs to the brain via afferent fibers. Normal vagal activity regulates the heart by the release of ACh at the SA node.

The sympathetic preganglionic fibers leave the CNS through the thoracic, lumbar, and (according to new information) sacral spinal nerves. The nerves which control the pelvic organs (bladder, rectum and genitalia) are embryologically similar to sympathetic fibers and are therefore members of the sympathetic cholinergic class, even though postganglionic fibers release acetylcholine.

The parasympathetic preganglionic fibers leave the CNS through the cranial nerves (especially the third, seventh, ninth, and tenth). It would be interesting to study how the visceral information is processed in the brainstem.

Note that the terms “sympathetic” and “parasympathetic” are anatomic designations and do not depend on the type of transmitter chemical released from the nerve endings nor on the kind of effect—excitatory or inhibitory—evoked by nerve activity.

Sympathetic innervation occurs between the segments C8 and L2 of the spinal cord and parasympathetic innervation occurs in cranial nerves and between the S2, S3 and S4 nerves – which consist of the splanchnic nerve. There are 2 sympathetic trunks, which contain ganglions; both become one at the ganglion impar, at the level of the sacrum. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves synapse with a ganglion before synapsing with the effector organ.

### ANS Physiology

### Molecular ANS

Classic synapses such as the mammalian neuromuscular junction and most neuron-neuron synapses are relatively “tight” in that the nerve terminates in small boutons are very close to the tissue innervated, so that the diffusion path from nerve terminal to postsynaptic receptors is very short. The effects are thus relatively rapid and localized. In contrast, junctions between autonomic neuron terminals and effector cells (smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands) differ from classic synapses in that transmitter is often released from a chain of varicosities in the postganglionic nerve fibers in the region of the smooth muscle cells rather than from boutons, and autonomic junctional clefts are wider than somatic synaptic clefts. Effects are thus slower in onset, and discharge of a single motor fibre often activates or inhibits many effector cells.

A large number of peripheral ANS fibers synthesize and release acetylcholine; they are cholinergic fibers; that is, they work by releasing acetylcholine. These include all preganglionic efferent autonomic fibers and the somatic (nonautonomic) motor fibers to skeletal muscle as well. Thus, almost all efferent fibers leaving the CNS are cholinergic. In addition, most parasympathetic postganglionic and some sympathetic postganglionic fibers are cholinergic. A significant number of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons use nitric oxide or peptides as the primary transmitter or as cotransmitters.

Most postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline); they are noradrenergic (often called simply “adrenergic”) fibers; that is, they work by releasing norepinephrine (noradrenaline). As noted, some sympathetic fibers release acetylcholine. Dopamine is a very important transmitter in the CNS, and it may be released by some peripheral sympathetic fibers under certain circumstances. Adrenal medullary cells, which are embryologically analogous to postganglionic sympathetic neurons, release a mixture of epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Check table 6-1 on page 135 for the primary neurotransmitters of the ANS and ENS.

Cocaine inhibits the NET, prolonging its effect in the synaptic cleft. Indirectly acting and mixed-action sympathomimetics, e.g., tyramine, amphetamines, and ephedrine, are capable of releasing stored transmitter from noradrenergic nerve endings by a calcium-independent process. These drugs are poor agonists (some are inactive) at adrenoceptors, but they are excellent substrates for monoamine transporters. As a result, they are avidly taken up into noradrenergic nerve endings by NET. In the nerve ending, they are then transported by VMAT into the vesicles, displacing norepinephrine, which is subsequently expelled into the synaptic space by reverse transport via NET. Catecholamines either diffuse away, suffer reuptake by NET or get metabolized by MAO (mitochondria) or COMT (post-synaptic neuron) There are many pharmacologically interesting action sites regarding the manipulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic response.

It has been known for many years that autonomic effector tissues (e.g., gut, airways, bladder) contain nerve fibers that do not show the histochemical characteristics of either cholinergic or adrenergic fibers. Both motor and sensory NANC (noradrenergic noncholinergic) fibers are present in these tissues.

At the highest level—midbrain and medulla—the two divisions of the ANS and the endocrine system are integrated with each other, with sensory input, and with information from higher CNS centers, including the cerebral cortex. These interactions are such that early investigators called the parasympathetic system a trophotropic one (i.e., leading to growth) used to “rest and digest” and the sympathetic system an ergotropic one (i.e., leading to energy expenditure), which is activated for “fight or flight.”

#### Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)

The reference electrode is usually placed on the right leg of the patient, not in line with the electrical field.

#### Defibrillation

During defibrillation, an electric shock is delivered to the heart using a device called a **defibrillator**. The shock is intended to stop the abnormal heart rhythm and allow the heart to reset itself and return to a normal rhythm. The shock is typically administered through two paddles or electrodes that are placed on the chest or directly on the heart, and the procedure is usually performed by trained medical personnel such as doctors, nurses, or paramedics.

The defibrillator is protected of pulses up to 5,000 V and 100 A.
