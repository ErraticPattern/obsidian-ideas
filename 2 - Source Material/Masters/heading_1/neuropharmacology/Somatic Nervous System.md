## Somatic Nervous System

### Neuron-Skeletal Muscle Interaction

A major part of the somatic nervous system concerns the function of motor output. Therefore, in this section it will be reviewed the skeletal muscular component of the **motor unit** (MU)– the designation for the functional interplay between a motor neuron and the muscle fibres it enervates. The bigger the muscle, the more muscle fibers are enervated by one motor neuron and vice-versa. **Henneman's size principle** relates the input and output properties of motoneurons and their muscle fibers to size and is the basis for size-ordered activation or recruitment of motor units during movement. Tonic MUs (type I fibers) are recruited first, since these are more excitable, and are more fatigue-resistant; phasic MUs (type II fibers) are recruited later, when the stimulus is increased.

Figure 165. A) A single muscle cell contains multiple myofibrils, each of which is comprised of numerous repeats of a complex protein assembly known as the sarcomere. (B) The banding pattern of a sarcomere, evident by electron microscopy, is caused by (C) the interdigitation of filaments made up of many individual proteins (Biochemistry, Stryer, 8 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) edition).

#### Skeletal Muscle Contraction

The motor neuron sends an electrical signal which is transduced as an end-plate potential at the neuromuscular junction, specifically at the motor endplate.

Figure 166. Motor endplate histology ([Source](https://histology.siu.edu/ssb/NM040b.htm)).

The EPP causes a depolarization throughout the muscle fibre’s sarcolemma, which is highly invaginated through the T-tubule system.

Figure 167. The end-plate potential resulting from the opening of acetylcholine receptor-channels opens voltage-gated sodium channels. The end-plate potential is normally large enough to open a sufficient number of voltage-gated Na+ channels to exceed the threshold for an action potential.

The depolarization will cause the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx of calcium will activate the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This receptor binds to the drug ryanodine and elevates cytoplasmic calcium concentration by mediating flux of calcium out of the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

The RyR is activated by a process known as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). This process involves the binding of Ca2+ to a specific site on the RyR protein, causing a conformational change that opens the channel and allows Ca2+ ions to flow out of the SR and into the cytoplasm. This initial Ca2+ release from the SR can further activate adjacent RyRs through CICR, leading to a massive Ca2+ release and muscle contraction. Afterwards, a component of the troponin complex senses the increase in Ca ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) and, in response, relieves the inhibition of myosin–actin interactions by tropomyosin.

Figure 168. The end-plate potential results in the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels on the surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to the release of calcium and its binding with troponin (Seeley’s Anatomy & Physiology, 10 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) edition).

After the release of calcium, myosin, the primary component of the thick filaments of the sarcomere, and actin which, along with the troponin and tropomyosin, composes the thin filaments, can interact, and begin the cycle of muscle contraction. The mechanism by which it happens depends on chemical reactions, including the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP.

Figure 169. Myosin motion along actin. A myosin head (yellow) in the apo form is bound to an actin filament (blue). The binding of ATP (1) results in the release of myosin from actin. The reversible hydrolysis of ATP bound to myosin (2) can result in the reorientation of the lever arm. With ATP hydrolyzed but still bound to actin, myosin can bind actin (3). The release of Pi (4) results in the reorientation of the lever arm and the concomitant motion of actin relative to myosin. The release of ADP (5) completes the cycle (Biochemistry, Stryer, 8th edition).

The end result is the simultaneous sliding of each type of filament over the other, and the consequent contraction of the sarcomere and muscle fibers.

Figure 170. Muscle contraction. Thick filaments are bipolar structures created by the association of many myosin molecules. (a) Muscle contraction occurs by the sliding of the thick and thin filaments past each other so that the Z disks in neighboring I bands draw closer together. (b) The thick and thin filaments are interleaved such that each thick filament is surrounded by six thin filaments (Principles of Biochemistry, Lehninger, 6 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) edition).

##### Heroin

It clamps the production of dopamine in neurons of the VTA. It inhibits the phrenic nerve when ingested in large quantities, leading to lack of pulmonary ventilation and subsequent death.

##### Opioids

Administration of opioids can reverse the clamping produced by heroin.

##### Cocaine and Amphetamines

Higher release of dopamine and serotonin (e.g., Ritalin).

#### Psychedelics

They include LSD, phencyclidine (PCP), and ketamine (special K). PCP, like ketamine (NMDA receptor antagonist), also act as a D2 receptor partial agonist.

##### Natural Psychedelics

- Mad honey

**Grayanotoxins** are a group of closely related neurotoxins named after _Leucothoe grayana_, a plant native to Japan originally named for 19th century American botanist Asa Gray. Grayanotoxin I (grayanotoxane-3,5,6,10,14,16-hexol 14-acetate) is also known as **andromedotoxin, acetylandromedol, rhodotoxin and asebotoxin.** Grayanotoxins are produced by Rhododendron species and other plants in the family Ericaceae. Honey made from the nectar and so containing pollen of these plants also contains grayanotoxins and is commonly referred to as **mad honey**. Consumption of the plant or any of its secondary products, including mad honey, can cause a rare poisonous reaction called grayanotoxin poisoning, mad honey disease, honey intoxication, or rhododendron poisoning. It is most frequently produced and consumed in regions of Nepal and Turkey as a recreational drug and traditional medicine.

##### Cannabinoids

THC is the main component.

#### Treatment

Treatment of addiction can involve drugs that block the ability of the drug of abuse to reach its target; to mimic the action of the drug to allow for rehabilitation; to influence the process of addiction itself.
