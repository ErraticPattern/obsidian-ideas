## Dopaminergic circuit

Nigrostriatal: consists of neurons that project from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum, which includes the caudate and putamen. It controls movement initiation and fine control of movements; involved in Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Mesolimbic: Pleasure and reward; Related areas include [[Amygdala]] and nucleus Accumbens. Mesocortical: Cognitive control, motivation and emotional response.

### Reward mechanisms

The Mesocortical pathway is responsible for the motivation and drive in doing reward-associated tasks. A habit is acquired by the activity of the ventral striatum, a dopamine-rich area, which is primed by the activity of the mesolimbic pathway.

Furthermore, the synthesis of oxytocin by the PVN leads to the activation of the VTA and subsequent activation of the NAcc. This in turn mediates reward-associated social situations and the motivation to seek these.

The ventral pallidum (VP) is hypothesized to act as a major output region in this pathway ultimately connecting with motor systems to initiate motivated action.

The tubero-infundibular pathway is also dependent on dopaminergic signalling. This system arises in the arcuate nuclei and periventricular neurons and releases dopamine into the pituitary portal circulation. It is known that dopaminergic neurons inhibit the hypophysis and the release of prolactin.
