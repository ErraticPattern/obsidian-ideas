## Astrocytic Influence on Circuits

Astrocytes have been shown to be major modulators of neuronal activity. Astrocytes are virtually everywhere, can sense signals, process these and create their own. Signal processing seems to be dependent on the type of calcium increase in astrocytes which will then propagate to other astrocytes and serve as a signal modulator, most likely acting only at a local level (circuit level).

Impairment of astrocytic exocytosis of gliotransmitters has shown to disrupt correlation of theta rhythms between hippocampus and PFC, leading to an impaired behavior phenotype in assays of spatial memory, in mice, when compared to wild-types.
