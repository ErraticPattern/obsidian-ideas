## Limbic System Circuits

The limbic system is a group of interconnected cortical and subcortical structures dedicated to linking visceral states and emotion to cognition and behaviour. The memory circuits are associated with the Limbic system which includes other aspects of behaviour such as controlling social interactions, regulating predatory behaviour, consolidating memories, and forming emotions.

The limbic system has always been considered as a complex arrangement of transitional structures situated between a visceral ‘primitive’ subcortical brain and a more evolved cortical one. The subcortical limbic structures include the amygdala, mammillary bodies, hypothalamus, some thalamic nuclei (i.e. anterior, intralaminar, and medial dorsal groups) and the ventral striatum (i.e. nucleus accumbens). The neurons and fibres composing the subcortical limbic structures present a simple arrangement, not dissimilar to other subcortical nuclei of the brainstem that regulate basic metabolism, respiration, and circulation.

The next level of organisation is the allocortex of the olfactory regions and hippocampal complex, where the neurons are well differentiated into layers and their dendrites show an orderly pattern of orientation. The corticoid and allocortical regions are grouped together into the limbic zone of the cerebral cortex as distinct from the paralimbic zone. The latter is mainly composed of ‘mesocortex’, whose progressive level of structural complexity ranges from a simplified arrangement similar to the allocortex, to the most complex six-layered isocortex.

### Emotion and Memory circuits

The cingulate gyrus was first assigned by James Papez to create the association between experiences or cognition with emotions. According to him, the cingulate gyrus can be activated either by the hippocampus, when it arises from cognition, or the hypothalamus, when it arises from visceral states. The activation of the cingulate cortex by the hippocampus was postulated to belong to a general circuit – the Papez circuit. A decade later, Paul Yakovlev, in 1948, independently from Papez, proposed that the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, amygdala, and anterior temporal lobe form a network underlying emotion and motivation.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 153.png>)MacLean’s 1952 (MacLean, 1949, 1952) proposal for a unitary model of the limbic system consisting of Papez circuit and Yakovlev’s amygdala-orbitofrontal network (Catani et al., 2013).

Three distinct but partially overlapping networks were identified: (i) the hippocampal-diencephalic-retrosplenial network dedicated to memory and spatial orientation;(ii) The temporo-amygdala-orbitofrontal network for the integration of visceral sensation and emotion with semantic memory and behaviour; (iii) the default-mode network involved in autobiographical memories and introspective self-directed thinking (Catani et al., 2013).

1. Some of the structures composing the network are particularly vulnerable to damage caused by viral infections (e.g. encephalitis) or alcohol (e.g. Korsakoff’s syndrome).
2. In animal studies, disconnection of the uncinate fasciculus causes impairment of object-reward association learning and reduced performances in memory tasks involving temporally complex visual information.
3. The anterior cingulate medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate-precuneus form the medial portion of the default-mode network are interconnected through the dorsal cingulum. In functional imaging studies the default-mode network is active during the ‘resting state’, a condition in which the majority of the subjects engage in an introspective, self-directed stream of thought (i.e. similar to daydreaming).

The main connections of the hippocampal-diencephalic network are the ventral cingulum, the fornix and the mammillo-thalamic tract (the endstations of this network are indicated in yellow). The main nodes of the temporo-amygdala-orbitofrontal network (indicated in green) are connected by the uncinate fasciculus. The dorsal cingulum is the main connection of the medial default network, whose cortical projections are shown in blue.

#### The hippocampal-diencephalic-retrosplenial circuit

To study the possible connections between hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the medial cingulate cortex (MCC), and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), several neurotracer techniques were used.

It was observed that hippocampal excitatory neurons target sparsely CG and densely superficial RSC (layer III); inhibitory input to the RSC is primarily seen in layer I. Hippocampal inputs elicit strongest responses in CG’s putative main cortical output region (layer V). The CG gets input exclusively from CA1 neurons.

### Memory-associated Decision Making

Areas of interest, in the rat:

Memory is one of the most important tools for decision making. It is known that amnesic patients not only have difficulty in forming new memories but also in planning their future life, i.e. they have trouble with decision-making – what to do when and where. The hippocampus is an area present in the so-called Papez circuit (see _emotion and memory_ section).

In the early 70's John O’Keefe (Nobel Prize in PM 2014) discovered neurons in the hippocampus whose activity is tightly regulated by the animal's position in space, e.g. they store, in the brain, a map of spatial coordinates, or spatial cognitive map. These neurons were then called place-cells and it was also shown that this place-cell neuronal activity would then be recreated while the animal slept.

This was the first evidence for the existence of cognitive maps in animals, in these case rodents, something defined decades earlier by Edward Chance Tolman who, in a series of seminal behavioral experiments using rats in mazes, concluded, against then-dominant theories, that “animals can learn facts about the world that they could subsequently use in a flexible manner”.

In 2006, Matt Wilson discovered that not only these maps can be formed, but they can be retrieved even though the animal is not performing the corresponding behavioral task ("offline"), lending support to the second aspect of the above postulate, that animals can subsequently use cognitive maps in a flexible manner. In other words, Matt Wilson discovered that hippocampal place-cells, whose activity is tightly modulated by the animal's location at any given moment, can reactivate outside their selectivity context. In other words a contextual representation can be replayed... or remembered. It is still not well understood how these neurons gain their place selectivity and how is this cognitive map used by other brain areas, to govern the animal's behavior ([Source](https://mremondes-brainmaps.weebly.com/projects.html)).

In the image below, concerning the work of Matt Wilson, it is possible to observe the selective firing of specific neurons at specific places in a one-dimensional track. Interestingly, at the end of the track, the rat would sometimes stop and all the neurons would fire replicating the same temporal pattern observed while the rat walked along the track. This showed that the animal can replay the positions in the track, while awake, in between laps.

The question now becomes how the hippocampus can represent time in episodic memories. A series of studies made by Remondes Lab, sung a waiting-to-trajectory methodology, trained rats to wait for a reward, while measuring hippocampal neurons. These results show that place-cells also fire to represent time and that this is achieved by the firing in sequence of several neurons, at specific times. Further studies showed, utilizing DREADDs methodology, that disruption of these neuron’s activity leads to an overestimation of time.

### Reward and Aversion

There are several areas which seem to regulate the valence of stimuli, such as the VTA, amygdala, habenula, and most importantly the NAcc (containing the so-called hedonic hotspots). The NAcc seems to react to both positive and negative stimuli. Furthermore, in studies of cue-reward association, it was shown that ~50-60% of neurons showed innate valence, while others showed learned valence. This learned valence might underlie Pavlovian learning.

The NAcc is mainly composed of inhibitory synapses and is of around ~90-95% of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and ~5-10% of interneurons. The NAcc gets dopaminergic input from the VTA and the former’s neurons express either D1 or D2 receptors.

There are around 16 different subtypes of D1 and D2 receptors in the NAcc. Depending on the duration of D1/D2 MSNs stimulation, it is possible to either induce reward-seeking behaviour (short duration) or aversion behavior (long duration). Additionally, situations of prolonged stimulation in D1/D2 MSNs are implicated in the production of opioids in these same neurons – dynorphins in D1 and enkephalins in D2 – which partially explains this time-dependent effect.

Additionally, the LDT seems to depend on cholinergic signalling and its inputs convey positive reinforcement signals. Interestingly, LDT and NAcc basal activity is disrupted in cases of cocaine consumption.
