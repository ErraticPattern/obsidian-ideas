# Psychiatric Disorders

Historically, psychiatric disorders used to be diagnosed by their causes, as determined by psychoanalysis, developed by Freud. Nowadays, psychiatric disorders are not biologically diagnosed but according to the symptoms presented. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) released a document called Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which contains information of psychiatry in general. In DSM-5, as opposed to previous versions of the document, besides a symptomatologic description, it is necessary to exist some kind of explanation, preferably biological, for a specific psychiatric syndrome.

The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients. Symptoms can be divided into positive and negative symptoms (as in for most of psychiatric disorders).

## Schizophrenia

The diagnostic criteria for Schizophrenia are present in the DSM-5 manual. They are defined by abnormalities in one or more of the following five domains: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and negative symptoms, which include: poor affective and social relations, negative formal thought disorders, failure to achieve expectation and flattened or blunted affect – See more in page 96 of DSM-5. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are also known as the psychotic symptoms.

Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) is a test which is now routinely administered as an indicator of schizophrenia.

The first drug to be given as an anti-psychotic was chlorpromazine. This compound is an antagonist of the histamine H1 receptors and was observed early to have a calming effect. Remarkably, chlorpromazine attenuated the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the administration of these first-generation anti-psychotics increase the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

However, Chlorpromazine is a neuroleptic agent; that is, it produces catalepsy in rodents and extra-pyramidal side effects (EPS) in humans, which lead to Parkinsonism. This occurs since there is blockage of D2-receptors several dopaminergic pathways (see dopaminergic pathways section). Note: the fact that anti-psychotics target D2 receptors doesn’t mean there is, necessarily, an upregulation of dopamine in schizophrenia.

Chlorpromazine is part of a first generation of anti-psychotic drugs. Although efficacy of these drugs is primarily driven by D2-receptor blockade, their adverse actions were traced to blocking effects at a wide range of receptors including α adrenoceptors and muscarinic, H1 histaminic, and 5-HT2 receptors.

The second-generation antipsychotic drugs (also called "atypical" antipsychotics) have a lower incidence of EPS than the first-generation agents but are associated with a higher risk of metabolic adverse effects, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and weight gain; overall, this generation of drugs is safer and controls the negative symptoms better. Most of these antagonize the 5-HT2A receptors and preventing inhibition of dopamine release by the serotonergic neurons. Aripiprazole also acts by being a partial agonist of dopamine and therefore creating a weaker response, diminishing the risk of EPS.

Interestingly, consumption of PCP, a selective antagonist of NMDARs, creates schizophrenia-like symptoms. It was discovered also that glutamatergic function is dysregulated in schizophrenia. One new type of developing drugs are inhibitors of glycine reuptake, which will aid in the activation of NMDARs.

## Tourette’s syndrome

## Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

## Delirium

The term ‘delirium’ is derived from the Latin word _delirare_, meaning ‘to go out of the furrow’, that is, to deviate from a straight line, to be deranged (Wilson et al., 2020).
