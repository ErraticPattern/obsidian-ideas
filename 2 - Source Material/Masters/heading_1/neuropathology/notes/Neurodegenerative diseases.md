# Neurodegenerative diseases

One of the biggest problems of neurodegenerative diseases is that etiology can almost never be established, since these diseases are much more prevalent in a sporadic form. Furthermore, since there might be so many putative causes associated with any neurodegenerative disease, which overlap extensively in this group of diseases, a correct diagnosis will only be possible when phenotypes of cognitive impairment are conspicuous and an early diagnosis will often be hard to make, due to lack of established disease biomarkers. One important question is whether the differentiation of several neurodegenerative diseases is impairing a more holistic view in which the etiology of each disease can be group into a broader range of phenomena such as that of aging and general loss of homeostasis. If this is so, then treating one neurodegenerative disease is not the same as cutting the problem at the root.

## Dementias

Degenerative diseases/Dementias can be classified according to localization or affected area and the associated deposited protein (e.g., amyloid and tau).

**Dementia with Lewi Bodies** is a variation of PD that first shows cortical symptoms and, later throughout the disease’s progression, motor symptoms. **Parkinson disease’s dementia** is the opposite.

## Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

The name Alzheimer’s dementia is used to describe the clinical syndrome that is associated with a specific neuropathological process defined by two hallmark features: namely, the accumulation of extracellular neuritic plaques composed primarily of 42-amino-acid amyloid-beta (Aβ1-42), a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and intracellular collections of neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated species of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). Typical AD (also referred to as amnestic or limbic form) is characterized by the insidious onset and gradual progression of memory loss in association with other cognitive domains (often visuospatial and executive function) that leads to a loss of functional independence. The amnesia seen in typical AD primarily affects declarative episodic memory (Ransdell & Nerbonne, 2018).

How to diagnose AD? When studying the familiar forms of AD, a protein called Aβ stands out as perhaps the main hallmark of AD. Fragments of Aβ can aggregate extracellularly due to the presence of cross-β sheets, leading to impaired neuronal functions and neuroinflammation. Tau protein aggregation is also highly associated with AD pathology, and both are required for a certain diagnosis. However, these hallmarks are sometimes absent in AD, leading some to think that Aβ aggregation cannot be the true cause of AD. For the current criteria for AD diagnosis see Ransdell & Nerbonne, 2018. Alzheimer Disease also has an **atypical form** in which there is Aβ and Tau aggregation but the initial location of degeneration is not the hippocampus.

S100B seems to have a role in AD pathophysiology. Since Zn ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) is deregulated in AD and leads to higher Aβ aggregation, and S100B interacts with it, it is possible that it has an important role in AD. Additionally, S100B attenuates Aβ aggregation and interacts with Tau, in its MTBR domain, which is responsible for Tau aggregation, and therefore inhibits it; furthermore, it also inhibits cell to cell spreading of toxic Tau oligomers. However, S100B should be highly regulated since it has pro-inflammatory functions in higher concentrations.

One of the hallmarks of AD includes the increased presence of TrkB-TC and absence of TrkB-FL, which explains why overexpression of BDNF as a possible therapy is futile. Aβ can activate NMDARs, which leads to an intracellular increase in calcium and excitotoxicity processes. Furthermore, this calcium increase will lead to increased activity of calpains. Calpains can then cleave TrkB-FL so that it creates a TrkB-TC and a smaller component called TrkB-ICD. This smaller domain leads to toxic effects and alteration of gene expression. Therapeutically, there are several targets in this process with potential value in attenuating AD.

## Frontotemporal Lateral Dementias (FTDs)

The most affected area is the language area, be it related with the fluency of language or semantic issues. The 3 most commonly associated proteins with FTLD are: Tau, TDP43 and FUS.
