# Cerebrovascular Pathologies

## Strokes

Can be either ischemic (85%) or hemorragic (15%). An ischemic event can also be either focalized, such as in the presence of a thrombus, or globalized, such as when there is sever hypotension or heart failure. Additionally, ischemia will lead to cavity formation in the long-run and lead to calcified neurons in the periphery.

## Vascular Pathology

Vascular occlusions include atherosclerosis plaques, which are prevalent in **high-calibre arteries.** Epilepsy is known to contribute to vascular pathology, most likely by the creation of ROS.

Figure 153. Aneurysms preferentially blossom in the Circle of Willis, with the anterior communicating artery being the most common location for rupture. The posterior communicating artery is the second most common site. Saccular aneurysms are more likely than fusiform to rupture.# Cerebrovascular Pathologies
