It can have 2 etiological perspectives: inside-out – Debris of myelin leads to neuroinflammatory processes – and outside-in – Immune cells recognize and attack myelin due to similarity with Epstein-Barr epitopes.

## Synapsopathies

## Rett Syndrome

Rett syndrome is a genetic disease which affects only females since the males do not survive this disease after birth. Characteristic symptoms of RTT include loss of acquired speech and motor skills, repetitive hand movements, breathing irregularities and seizures. RTT patients may also suffer from sporadic episodes of gastrointestinal problems, hypoplasia, early-onset osteoporosis, bruxism and screaming spells. Rett syndrome cases were found associated to damaging missense, frameshift and nonsense mutations in the coding region of the gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). In fact, mutations in MECP2 account for 95% of typical RTT cases (Kyle et al., 2018).

MeCP2 is an abundant nuclear protein that was originally identified in a screen for proteins with methyl-DNA-specific binding activity. It is ubiquitously expressed throughout all human tissues, but is particularly abundant within neurons. In the central nervous system (CNS), MeCP2 is expressed at low levels prenatally, but progressively increases during neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis reaching its peak in mature, post-migratory neurons, suggesting a role for MeCP2 in maintaining neuronal maturation, activity and plasticity (Kyle et al., 2018).

It is also known that BDNF and A2A receptors are downregulated, making administrated BDNF a possible choice for therapy. Since BDNF doesn’t cross the BBB, its administration is impractical and not effective, the boosting of ADO might be a more promising approach.# Genetic Diseases
