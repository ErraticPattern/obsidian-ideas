## Visual snow syndrome (VSS)

**Visual snow syndrome (VSS) ([[#^footnote-44|Comment Unknown Author 44]])** is a form of visual hallucination that is characterized by the perception of small, flickering dots throughout the entire visual field. It is present in all conditions of illumination. The dots remain individual and do not clump together or change in size. Visual snow exists in one of two forms: the pulse type and the broadband type.

In the pulse type, the dots are the same color as their background and tend to flicker individually, sometimes suggestive of raindrops on a car windshield. In black pulse visual snow, the dots are always darker than their background, whereas in white pulse the dots are always lighter than their background.

In the broadband type, the noise is perceived as a coarse texture. The noise is bipolar and occurs in contrast to the background: with a light background the dots will appear dark, and with a dark background the dots will appear light.
