# Epilepsy

It occurs to a synchronous occurrence of cortical activity. Etiologically, epilepsy can be caused by a genetic factor - idiopathic/primary epilepsy – (e.g., channelopathies), by structural/metabolic/infectious/immune causes – secondary epilepsy – or by unknown causes. **Epileptogenesis** is the name given to the process by which a neural circuit passes form a healthy state into a hyperexcitable state – it begins with an initial insult. **Ictogenesis** refers to the mechanisms by which epileptic crisis are generated.

The most common form is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Common causes of epilepsy include mesial temporal sclerosis, tumours, and cortical development malformations.

**Tumours**

The incidence of people with brain tumours that usually have epilepsy as the first symptom is around 30-50% of all cases. The number goes up to 90% if it is a slow growing tumour.

Types of epileptogenic tumours ([[#^footnote-41|Comment Unknown Author 41]]):

- **Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)**: it is a low-grade, slow-growing brain tumor. It is a glioneuronal tumor, which means it contains properties of both glial and neuronal cells.
- **Ganglioglioma**: comprises a mixed population of mature neurons ("ganglio-") and glial cells (-"glioma"). Thus, immunochemistry will stain the neuronal component (synaptophysin, chromogranin, neurofilament, etc...) and the glial component (GFAP).
- **Gangliocytoma**: purely comprises mature neurons. Because of their neuronal origin, these tumors stain neuronal markers (synaptophysin, MAP-2, neurofilament, NeuN, etc...).
- **Meningioma**
- **Diffuse gliomas**

Tumours are epileptogenic because of localization, brain tissue compression, secretion of molecules and rewiring of neural circuits.
