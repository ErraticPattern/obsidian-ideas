### Epilepsy

It occurs to a synchronous occurrence of cortical activity. Etiologically, epilepsy can be caused by a genetic factor - idiopathic/primary epilepsy – (e.g., channelopathies), by structural/metabolic/infectious/immune causes – secondary epilepsy – or by unknown causes. **Epileptogenesis** is the name given to the process by which a neural circuit passes form a healthy state into a hyperexcitable state – it begins with an initial insult. **Ictogenesis** refers to the mechanisms by which epileptic crisis are generated.

The most common form is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Common causes of epilepsy include mesial temporal sclerosis, tumours, and cortical development malformations.

**Tumours**

The incidence of people with brain tumours that usually have epilepsy as the first symptom is around 30-50% of all cases. The number goes up to 90% if it is a slow growing tumour.

Types of epileptogenic tumours ([[#^footnote-41|Comment Unknown Author 41]]):

- **Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)**: it is a low-grade, slow-growing brain tumor. It is a glioneuronal tumor, which means it contains properties of both glial and neuronal cells.
- **Ganglioglioma**: comprises a mixed population of mature neurons ("ganglio-") and glial cells (-"glioma"). Thus, immunochemistry will stain the neuronal component (synaptophysin, chromogranin, neurofilament, etc...) and the glial component (GFAP).
- **Gangliocytoma**: purely comprises mature neurons. Because of their neuronal origin, these tumors stain neuronal markers (synaptophysin, MAP-2, neurofilament, NeuN, etc...).
- **Meningioma**
- **Diffuse gliomas**

Tumours are epileptogenic because of localization, brain tissue compression, secretion of molecules and rewiring of neural circuits.

### Neurodegenerative diseases

One of the biggest problems of neurodegenerative diseases is that etiology can almost never be established, since these diseases are much more prevalent in a sporadic form. Furthermore, since there might be so many putative causes associated with any neurodegenerative disease, which overlap extensively in this group of diseases, a correct diagnosis will only be possible when phenotypes of cognitive impairment are conspicuous and an early diagnosis will often be hard to make, due to lack of established disease biomarkers. One important question is whether the differentiation of several neurodegenerative diseases is impairing a more holistic view in which the etiology of each disease can be group into a broader range of phenomena such as that of aging and general loss of homeostasis. If this is so, then treating one neurodegenerative disease is not the same as cutting the problem at the root.

#### Dementias

Degenerative diseases/Dementias can be classified according to localization or affected area and the associated deposited protein (e.g., amyloid and tau).

**Dementia with Lewi Bodies** is a variation of PD that first shows cortical symptoms and, later throughout the disease’s progression, motor symptoms. **Parkinson disease’s dementia** is the opposite.

#### Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

The name Alzheimer’s dementia is used to describe the clinical syndrome that is associated with a specific neuropathological process defined by two hallmark features: namely, the accumulation of extracellular neuritic plaques composed primarily of 42-amino-acid amyloid-beta (Aβ1-42), a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and intracellular collections of neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated species of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). Typical AD (also referred to as amnestic or limbic form) is characterized by the insidious onset and gradual progression of memory loss in association with other cognitive domains (often visuospatial and executive function) that leads to a loss of functional independence. The amnesia seen in typical AD primarily affects declarative episodic memory (Ransdell & Nerbonne, 2018).

How to diagnose AD? When studying the familiar forms of AD, a protein called Aβ stands out as perhaps the main hallmark of AD. Fragments of Aβ can aggregate extracellularly due to the presence of cross-β sheets, leading to impaired neuronal functions and neuroinflammation. Tau protein aggregation is also highly associated with AD pathology, and both are required for a certain diagnosis. However, these hallmarks are sometimes absent in AD, leading some to think that Aβ aggregation cannot be the true cause of AD. For the current criteria for AD diagnosis see Ransdell & Nerbonne, 2018. Alzheimer Disease also has an **atypical form** in which there is Aβ and Tau aggregation but the initial location of degeneration is not the hippocampus.

S100B seems to have a role in AD pathophysiology. Since Zn ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 2]]) is deregulated in AD and leads to higher Aβ aggregation, and S100B interacts with it, it is possible that it has an important role in AD. Additionally, S100B attenuates Aβ aggregation and interacts with Tau, in its MTBR domain, which is responsible for Tau aggregation, and therefore inhibits it; furthermore, it also inhibits cell to cell spreading of toxic Tau oligomers. However, S100B should be highly regulated since it has pro-inflammatory functions in higher concentrations.

One of the hallmarks of AD includes the increased presence of TrkB-TC and absence of TrkB-FL, which explains why overexpression of BDNF as a possible therapy is futile. Aβ can activate NMDARs, which leads to an intracellular increase in calcium and excitotoxicity processes. Furthermore, this calcium increase will lead to increased activity of calpains. Calpains can then cleave TrkB-FL so that it creates a TrkB-TC and a smaller component called TrkB-ICD. This smaller domain leads to toxic effects and alteration of gene expression. Therapeutically, there are several targets in this process with potential value in attenuating AD.

#### Frontotemporal Lateral Dementias (FTDs)

The most affected area is the language area, be it related with the fluency of language or semantic issues. The 3 most commonly associated proteins with FTLD are: Tau, TDP43 and FUS.

#### Corticobasal syndrome

#### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease characterized by degenerative changes in both upper and lower motor neurons (bulbar-onset and spinal-onset). Stephen Hawking was a famous person suffering of ALS. There is a familiar and sporadic type, the latter being much more prevalent.

#### Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)

#### Others

#### Multiple Sclerosis

It can have 2 etiological perspectives: inside-out – Debris of myelin leads to neuroinflammatory processes – and outside-in – Immune cells recognize and attack myelin due to similarity with Epstein-Barr epitopes.

#### Synapsopathies

#### Rett Syndrome

Rett syndrome is a genetic disease which affects only females since the males do not survive this disease after birth. Characteristic symptoms of RTT include loss of acquired speech and motor skills, repetitive hand movements, breathing irregularities and seizures. RTT patients may also suffer from sporadic episodes of gastrointestinal problems, hypoplasia, early-onset osteoporosis, bruxism and screaming spells. Rett syndrome cases were found associated to damaging missense, frameshift and nonsense mutations in the coding region of the gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). In fact, mutations in MECP2 account for 95% of typical RTT cases (Kyle et al., 2018).

MeCP2 is an abundant nuclear protein that was originally identified in a screen for proteins with methyl-DNA-specific binding activity. It is ubiquitously expressed throughout all human tissues, but is particularly abundant within neurons. In the central nervous system (CNS), MeCP2 is expressed at low levels prenatally, but progressively increases during neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis reaching its peak in mature, post-migratory neurons, suggesting a role for MeCP2 in maintaining neuronal maturation, activity and plasticity (Kyle et al., 2018).

It is also known that BDNF and A2A receptors are downregulated, making administrated BDNF a possible choice for therapy. Since BDNF doesn’t cross the BBB, its administration is impractical and not effective, the boosting of ADO might be a more promising approach.

### Psychiatric Disorders

Historically, psychiatric disorders used to be diagnosed by their causes, as determined by psychoanalysis, developed by Freud. Nowadays, psychiatric disorders are not biologically diagnosed but according to the symptoms presented. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) released a document called Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which contains information of psychiatry in general. In DSM-5, as opposed to previous versions of the document, besides a symptomatologic description, it is necessary to exist some kind of explanation, preferably biological, for a specific psychiatric syndrome.

The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients. Symptoms can be divided into positive and negative symptoms (as in for most of psychiatric disorders).

#### Schizophrenia

The diagnostic criteria for Schizophrenia are present in the DSM-5 manual. They are defined by abnormalities in one or more of the following five domains: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and negative symptoms, which include: poor affective and social relations, negative formal thought disorders, failure to achieve expectation and flattened or blunted affect – See more in page 96 of DSM-5. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are also known as the psychotic symptoms.

Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) is a test which is now routinely administered as an indicator of schizophrenia.

The first drug to be given as an anti-psychotic was chlorpromazine. This compound is an antagonist of the histamine H1 receptors and was observed early to have a calming effect. Remarkably, chlorpromazine attenuated the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the administration of these first-generation anti-psychotics increase the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

However, Chlorpromazine is a neuroleptic agent; that is, it produces catalepsy in rodents and extra-pyramidal side effects (EPS) in humans, which lead to Parkinsonism. This occurs since there is blockage of D2-receptors several dopaminergic pathways (see dopaminergic pathways section). Note: the fact that anti-psychotics target D2 receptors doesn’t mean there is, necessarily, an upregulation of dopamine in schizophrenia.

Chlorpromazine is part of a first generation of anti-psychotic drugs. Although efficacy of these drugs is primarily driven by D2-receptor blockade, their adverse actions were traced to blocking effects at a wide range of receptors including α adrenoceptors and muscarinic, H1 histaminic, and 5-HT2 receptors.

The second-generation antipsychotic drugs (also called "atypical" antipsychotics) have a lower incidence of EPS than the first-generation agents but are associated with a higher risk of metabolic adverse effects, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and weight gain; overall, this generation of drugs is safer and controls the negative symptoms better. Most of these antagonize the 5-HT2A receptors and preventing inhibition of dopamine release by the serotonergic neurons. Aripiprazole also acts by being a partial agonist of dopamine and therefore creating a weaker response, diminishing the risk of EPS.

Interestingly, consumption of PCP, a selective antagonist of NMDARs, creates schizophrenia-like symptoms. It was discovered also that glutamatergic function is dysregulated in schizophrenia. One new type of developing drugs are inhibitors of glycine reuptake, which will aid in the activation of NMDARs.

#### Tourette’s syndrome

#### Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

#### Delirium

The term ‘delirium’ is derived from the Latin word _delirare_, meaning ‘to go out of the furrow’, that is, to deviate from a straight line, to be deranged (Wilson et al., 2020).

### Cerebrovascular Pathologies

#### Strokes

Can be either ischemic (85%) or hemorragic (15%). An ischemic event can also be either focalized, such as in the presence of a thrombus, or globalized, such as when there is sever hypotension or heart failure. Additionally, ischemia will lead to cavity formation in the long-run and lead to calcified neurons in the periphery.

#### Vascular Pathology

Vascular occlusions include atherosclerosis plaques, which are prevalent in **high-calibre arteries.** Epilepsy is known to contribute to vascular pathology, most likely by the creation of ROS.

### Other Syndromes

#### Visual snow syndrome (VSS)

**Visual snow syndrome (VSS) ([[#^footnote-44|Comment Unknown Author 44]])** is a form of visual hallucination that is characterized by the perception of small, flickering dots throughout the entire visual field. It is present in all conditions of illumination. The dots remain individual and do not clump together or change in size. Visual snow exists in one of two forms: the pulse type and the broadband type.

In the pulse type, the dots are the same color as their background and tend to flicker individually, sometimes suggestive of raindrops on a car windshield. In black pulse visual snow, the dots are always darker than their background, whereas in white pulse the dots are always lighter than their background.

In the broadband type, the noise is perceived as a coarse texture. The noise is bipolar and occurs in contrast to the background: with a light background the dots will appear dark, and with a dark background the dots will appear light.
