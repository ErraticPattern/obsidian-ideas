### Clinical Investigation

The investigation’s question should follow the **FINER** principle: Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant.

There are 2 types of inferences:

- **Internal Validation**

The degree by which correct conclusions can be taken about the results of the study.

- **External Validation**

The degree by which the conclusions of the study can be taken to those that did not participate in the study.

The **statistical analysis** should involve a calculation of the necessary sample size ([Website](http://www.openepi.com/) for calculation of sample size and other statistical parameters) and the formulation of a hypothesis which should follow the **PICO** principle: Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome.

For an overview of the criteria that should be followed by epidemiological studies, check [website](https://www.strobe-statement.org/).

#### Systematic Review

See this [website](http://prisma-statement.org/) for more information on how to write a systematic review.

#### Cohort Studies

A cohort is defined as a well-defined group of individuals without the condition which will be the condition to be studied.

#### Case-Control

#### Diagnostic Tests

A way of getting quantitative/qualitative data in order to decide a certain diagnosis.

**Qualitative:**

- Kappa statistics – 0.7 is cut off point for reproducibility (2/3 observers).
- ASPECTS classification (CT scan in stroke).

**Quantitative:**

- CV.
- See statistical section.
- Accurate ->
- Gold standard -> best test for the diagnosis.
- PET scan para AD.
- Test needs to be as close to gold standard but more practical. To use GS to test other diagnostics.
- Proportions -> CI’s (95%).
- AUC or c statistic.
- Accuracy-> sensibility and specificity.
- Simple RCT – controls for confounding variables.
- Diagnostic test -> diminishes morbidities. Best test (utility) is that which allows for better treatment.

#### Longitudinal Studies

The **experience sampling method (ESM),** also referred to as a daily diary method, or ecological momentary assessment (EMA), is an intensive longitudinal research methodology that involves asking participants to report on their thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and/or environment on multiple occasions over time. Participants report on their thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and/or environment in the moment (right then, not later; right there, not elsewhere) or shortly thereafter.

##### Psychological Scales

- **Beck Depression Inventory (BDI):** This is a widely used assessment scale designed to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals.
- **State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI):** This scale measures the presence and severity of current symptoms of anxiety and a generalized propensity to be anxious.
- **Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI):** This is used to identify personal, social, and behavioral issues in psychiatric patients.
- **Rorschach Test:** This is a projective test used to examine a person’s personality characteristics and emotional functioning.
- **Thematic Apperception Test (TAT):** This is a projective psychological test where respondents reveal underlying motives, concerns, and the way they see the social world through the stories they make up about ambiguous pictures.
- **Children’s Apperception Test (CAT):** This is a projective story telling technique used to measure a variety of variables including anxiety, body image, self-concept, etc.
- **Senile Apperception Test (SAT):** This is used to assess perception and cognitive function in the elderly.
- **Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS):** This scale measures psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and unusual behaviour.
- **Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PNSS):** This is used to measure the severity of positive and negative symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia.
- **Andreasen’s Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms and Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SANS and SAPS):** These scales are used to assess the presence and severity of positive and negative symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia.
