## Beginning and History

### Neuroscientists

- [[Hippocrates]] (460-370 BCE)

Defended the hegemonic role of the brain.

- [[Alcmaeon of Croton]] (ca. 450 BCE)**

First to defend the hegemonic role of the brain.

- [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] (150 BCE)
- [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] (25 BCE-50 CE)
- [[Galen of Pergamon]] (129-213)

Galen used piglets in his experiments on brain lesions. He found that anterior brain damage had less deleterious effects than posterior. He ridiculed the view of the Alexandrian anatomist Erasistratus that intelligence was correlated with the number of cerebral convolutions, noting, ‘‘Even donkeys have a complex encephalon, whereas judging by their stupidity ought to be perfectly simple and uncomplicated.’’ He also discovered the ventral and dorsal spinal roots as containing distinct kinds of information.

Confirmed the existence of higher functions in the cortex.

Often called ‘‘the father of English neurology’’.

Pioneer in the work of cortical function localization in monkeys.
