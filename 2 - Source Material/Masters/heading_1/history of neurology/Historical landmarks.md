## Historical landmarks

### On trepanation

The oldest known surgical procedure is trepanation or trephination, the removal of a piece of bone from the skull. It was practiced from the late Palaeolithic period and in virtually every part of the world. It is still used in both Western and non-Western medicine. We consider the methods and motives of trephining in different times and cultures. Below are represented the current landmarks utilized for any kind of brain surgery. (C. Gross)

### Proving brain function is associated with activity of the mind

The cognitive functions of humans were, historically, in its majority, attributed to the visceras rather than the brain. The first to think of the brain has the cause of our phenomenal experience were Alcmaeon and Hippocrates; however, there was opposition from Aristoteles, who thought the heart was responsible for our experience. The arguments given by the latter are present in page 27 (C. Gross). Galen lived in the stoic era, whose belief about the origin of mind was Aristotelean. ([[#^footnote-2|Comment Unknown Author 2]])

In the course of one of these experiments, carried out on a strapped down pig as it struggled and squealed, Galen accidentally cut the recurrent laryngeal nerves, which branch from the vagus nerve and innervate the larynx, and the pig stopped squealing but not struggling. This showed that the heart was not responsible for the creation of voice, thought at the time to be the same as the action of the mind, widely accepted as being in the heart. Although, as already stated, Galen was not the first to propose the hegemony of the brain, it was he who first gave a demonstration of it, in vivo, in a pig.

### Discovery of the inner workings of vision

In classical antiquity, the theory that vision was possible due to emission of rays from the eye reigned. Theories of vision such as this one, which depend on something streaming out of the eye, are known as extramission theories; the phosphene effect was used as an argument supporting it. ([[#^footnote-3|Comment Unknown Author 3]])

The first intromission theories were those of the atomists such as Democritus and Epicurus. Only after Kepler, with his work on light and inversion of the image on the retina, did the extramission theory of vision get accepted in the scientific community.

### Discovery of the motor cortex

The modern neurophysiology of the cerebral cortex began in 1870 with the discovery by Gustav Fritsch (1838–1927) and Edmund Hitzig (1838–1907) that electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex produces movements. However, the foundations of this discovery had been established much earlier, some of which will be noted below:

From the earliest Western medical writings it was thought that the movement of the body was controlled by the brain. In the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, whose origins lie in the Pyramid Age (about 30 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) century BCE) there are a number of descriptions of motor dysfunctions after head injury. See reference for more information. This seems to be humanity’s first written account of neurological knowledge.

Alexander Monroe (1697–1762) showed that ligating a nerve produced no distal swelling and nothing flowed from a cut nerve. Having disproved pneuma as a transmitter of nerve activity to muscle, Monroe suggested that, instead, electricity might be the mechanism. First surmising on electricity having a role in nerve transmission?

Historically, the cortex was considered as the rind of the brain, with no important function, which lay above the highest sensory structure, the thalamus, and the highest motor structure, the corpus striatum (presumed in that time). Besides a few earlier accounts of cortical functions, phrenology was the first main movement of importance to try to give an account of cortical function localization and it consisted in an attempt to relate psychological functions to the organs of the cerebral cortex—to relate brain and behavior. Phrenology was based on four assumptions: (1) Intellectual abilities and personality traits are differentially developed in each individual. (2) These abilities and traits reflect faculties that are localized in specific organs of the cerebral cortex. (3) The development or prominence of these faculties is a function of the activity and therefore the size of the cortical organs. (4) The size of each cortical organ is reflected in the prominence of the overlying skull, i.e., in cranial bumps. See figure 4.5 – it is an interesting drawing of the cortex.

Further confirmation of cortical function localization was given by Paul Broca and the discovery of Broca’s area in cases of language dysfunction; confirmation began in a patient with long-standing language difficulties, nicknamed ‘‘Tan’’ because that was all that he could say. Thus, it was phrenology which led to the contemporary ubiquitous use of imaging data in order to associate structure with behaviour.

While there were reports of effects of stimulation of the spinal cord and brain stem, all attempts at eliciting effects of stimulation of the cerebral cortex had been universally ineffective. Also, some central nervous system structures were excitable and yet the cortex didn’t seem to be. These observations led to the motor cortex stimulation experiment. Ferrier followed the experiments of cortical stimulation, albeit mainly on monkeys. The two contrasting views that first emerged with Fritsch and Hitzig’s stress on brief muscle twitches and Ferrier’s stress on integrated movements became central issues in the study of motor cortex. See this chapter for the differences of employed methodologies; most notably, the use of DC and AC stimuli. Building on the ideas of Ferrier, some studies suggest that the organization of motor cortex may be understood as the result of the superimposition on a somatotopic map of other ‘‘maps’’ such as of ethologically relevant movements and of hand position in space. Very interesting idea which I was unaware of and of which no mention was given in my classes.
