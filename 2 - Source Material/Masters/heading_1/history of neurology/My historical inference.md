## My historical inference

Intuitively, we can understand that the brain is somehow connected to our phenomenological experience. It was hard to understand this historically, but by studying anatomy and certain injuries, it was realized that experience changes if the brain loses its blood supply or gets deformed in some way. I experienced the former myself.

Such a history of this realization would be interesting, and I hope I can know more about it in the future. I shall update this entry if I learn more about it (see above).

Well, there was a point in history in which the brain was analysed in a serious way, by way of dissection and observation (more information above). This and other methods underlie basic neuroanatomy. The main lines of analysis include anatomical, embryological, comparative, observational, physiological, and pathological.

The basic criteria for distinction of structures were shape and color, by way of observation. Grey matter and white matter were distinguished. Anatomical analysis gives insight into the connections of the brain. Comparing the brain with other organs hints at uniqueness and specialization of function. Embryological analysis hints at importance of function. Finally, physiological, and pathological analysis hint at functions of the brain. This crude but efficient methods of analysis allowed for the study of hypothesis about the brain and marked the beginning of neuroscience. As such, these shall be the pillars of my own journey.
