### Trepanation
The oldest known surgical procedure is trepanation or trephination, the removal of a piece of bone from the skull. It was practiced from the late Palaeolithic period and in virtually every part of the world. It is still used in both Western and non-Western medicine. We consider the methods and motives of trephining in different times and cultures. Below are represented the current landmarks utilized for any kind of brain surgery. (C. Gross)
