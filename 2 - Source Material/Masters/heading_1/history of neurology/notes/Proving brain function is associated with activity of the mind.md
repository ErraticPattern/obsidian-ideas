### Proving brain function is associated with activity of the mind

The cognitive functions of humans were, historically, in its majority, attributed to the visceras rather than the brain. The first to think of the brain has the cause of our phenomenal experience were Alcmaeon and Hippocrates; however, there was opposition from Aristoteles, who thought the heart was responsible for our experience. The arguments given by the latter are present in page 27 (C. Gross). Galen lived in the stoic era, whose belief about the origin of mind was Aristotelean. ([[#^footnote-2|Comment Unknown Author 2]])

In the course of one of these experiments, carried out on a strapped down pig as it struggled and squealed, Galen accidentally cut the recurrent laryngeal nerves, which branch from the vagus nerve and innervate the larynx, and the pig stopped squealing but not struggling. This showed that the heart was not responsible for the creation of voice, thought at the time to be the same as the action of the mind, widely accepted as being in the heart. Although, as already stated, Galen was not the first to propose the hegemony of the brain, it was he who first gave a demonstration of it, in vivo, in a pig.
