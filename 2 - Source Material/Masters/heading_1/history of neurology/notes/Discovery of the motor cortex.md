### Discovery of the motor cortex

The modern neurophysiology of the cerebral cortex began in 1870 with the discovery by Gustav Fritsch (1838–1927) and Edmund Hitzig (1838–1907) that electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex produces movements. However, the foundations of this discovery had been established much earlier, some of which will be noted below:

From the earliest Western medical writings it was thought that the movement of the body was controlled by the brain. In the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, whose origins lie in the Pyramid Age (about 30 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) century BCE) there are a number of descriptions of motor dysfunctions after head injury. See reference for more information. This seems to be humanity’s first written account of neurological knowledge.

Alexander Monroe (1697–1762) showed that ligating a nerve produced no distal swelling and nothing flowed from a cut nerve. Having disproved pneuma as a transmitter of nerve activity to muscle, Monroe suggested that, instead, electricity might be the mechanism. First surmising on electricity having a role in nerve transmission?

Historically, the cortex was considered as the rind of the brain, with no important function, which lay above the highest sensory structure, the thalamus, and the highest motor structure, the corpus striatum (presumed in that time). Besides a few earlier accounts of cortical functions, phrenology was the first main movement of importance to try to give an account of cortical function localization and it consisted in an attempt to relate psychological functions to the organs of the cerebral cortex—to relate brain and behavior. Phrenology was based on four assumptions: (1) Intellectual abilities and personality traits are differentially developed in each individual. (2) These abilities and traits reflect faculties that are localized in specific organs of the cerebral cortex. (3) The development or prominence of these faculties is a function of the activity and therefore the size of the cortical organs. (4) The size of each cortical organ is reflected in the prominence of the overlying skull, i.e., in cranial bumps. See figure 4.5 – it is an interesting drawing of the cortex.

Further confirmation of cortical function localization was given by Paul Broca and the discovery of Broca’s area in cases of language dysfunction; confirmation began in a patient with long-standing language difficulties, nicknamed ‘‘Tan’’ because that was all that he could say. Thus, it was phrenology which led to the contemporary ubiquitous use of imaging data in order to associate structure with behaviour.

While there were reports of effects of stimulation of the spinal cord and brain stem, all attempts at eliciting effects of stimulation of the cerebral cortex had been universally ineffective. Also, some central nervous system structures were excitable and yet the cortex didn’t seem to be. These observations led to the motor cortex stimulation experiment. Ferrier followed the experiments of cortical stimulation, albeit mainly on monkeys. The two contrasting views that first emerged with Fritsch and Hitzig’s stress on brief muscle twitches and Ferrier’s stress on integrated movements became central issues in the study of motor cortex. See this chapter for the differences of employed methodologies; most notably, the use of DC and AC stimuli. Building on the ideas of Ferrier, some studies suggest that the organization of motor cortex may be understood as the result of the superimposition on a somatotopic map of other ‘‘maps’’ such as of ethologically relevant movements and of hand position in space. Very interesting idea which I was unaware of and of which no mention was given in my classes.
