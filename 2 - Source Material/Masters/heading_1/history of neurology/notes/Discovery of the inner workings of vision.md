### Discovery of the inner workings of vision

In classical antiquity, the theory that vision was possible due to emission of rays from the eye reigned. Theories of vision such as this one, which depend on something streaming out of the eye, are known as extramission theories; the phosphene effect was used as an argument supporting it. ([[#^footnote-3|Comment Unknown Author 3]])

The first intromission theories were those of the atomists such as Democritus and Epicurus. Only after Kepler, with his work on light and inversion of the image on the retina, did the extramission theory of vision get accepted in the scientific community.
