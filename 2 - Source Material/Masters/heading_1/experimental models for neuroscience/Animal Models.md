## Animal Models

Galen usually presented his dissections as if they were of the human, but, in fact, they were invariably of animals, usually the **ox** in the case of brain anatomy, **the Barbary ‘‘ape’’ (the macaque M. sylvana)** for cranial nerve anatomy, and **pigs** for vivisection. Studies on the function of the recurrent laryngeal nerve also confirmed that their bilateral section in **dogs, goats, bears, lions, cows, monkeys and other animals** eliminated vocalization.

### Invertebrates

#### Roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans)

### Rodents

#### Rat (Rattus norvegicus)

#### Mouse (Mus musculus)

#### African spiny mice (Acomys)

Usually, adult mammals show very limited neuronal regeneration and only in the peripheral nervous system. The African Spiny mice show extreme regeneration of several cell types, including, most notably, neurons. Furthermore, this regeneration is both seen peripherally and centrally (spinal cord).

### Mammals

#### Dolphin

It is a very interesting animal model since it has a highly gyrified cortex and has been shown to have no adult neurogenesis.
