## Electricity and the Nervous System

The eighteenth century was a period of great activity and interest in the new discoveries about electricity in both the salons and laboratories of the time. Among the intriguing gadgets were electrostatic machines, the Leyden jar (the original capacitor) and the gold leaf electroscope (which detects static electricity).

The modern study of the electrical nature of nervous activity began with Luigi Galvani’s (1737–1798) demonstration that electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve in a severed frog’s leg resulted in contraction of the attached muscle. These findings sparked a fierce debate between Galvani and Alessandro Volta (1745–1827) concerning the source of the electricity that caused the legs to become ‘‘reanimated.’’

### Neural Communication

#### Ephatic Coupling

Ephaptic coupling is a form of communication within the nervous system and is distinct from direct communication systems like electrical synapses and chemical synapses. It may refer to the coupling of adjacent (touching) nerve fibers caused by the exchange of ions between the cells, or it may refer to coupling of nerve fibers as a result of local electric fields. In either case ephaptic coupling can influence the synchronization and timing of action potential firing in neurons. Myelination is thought to inhibit ephaptic interactions.

#### Shunting Inhibition

Shunting inhibition, also known as divisive inhibition, is a form of postsynaptic potential inhibition that can be represented mathematically as reducing the excitatory potential by division, rather than linear subtraction.
