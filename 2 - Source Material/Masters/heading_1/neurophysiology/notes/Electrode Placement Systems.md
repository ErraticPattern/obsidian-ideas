##### Electrode Placement Systems

There are two main EEG configurations which standardize electrode placement: the [[10-20 standard system]] and the [[10-10 standard system]]. The latter is used for more spatial resolution. There are however other EEG setups which have a much higher number of electrodes. Convention dictates that right-hemisphere electrodes have an even number representation, while left side electrodes have an odd number representation. The letter representation dictates the brain area over which the electrode is placed.
