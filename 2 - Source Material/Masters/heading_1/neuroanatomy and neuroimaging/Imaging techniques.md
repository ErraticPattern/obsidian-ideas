The Golgi stain (left) reveals a subset of neuronal cell bodies, axons, and dendritic trees. The Nissl method (middle) shows cell bodies and proximal dendrites. The Weigert stain (right) reveals the pattern of myelinated fibers.

**Specific Techniques**

- Hematoxylin & Eosin

Hematoxylin is a basic dye that stains acidic structures, such as the nuclei of cells, a blue-purple color. This allows for the visualization of the number, size, shape, and organization of the cells within a tissue sample.

Eosin is an acidic dye that stains basic structures, such as the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, a pink-red color. This allows for the visualization of the cell boundaries and the extracellular components of a tissue sample.

Together, hematoxylin and eosin ([[#^footnote-4|Comment Unknown Author 4]]) staining allows for the visualization of the general morphology and organization of cells within a tissue sample, which can be used to identify and diagnose a variety of diseases, including cancers and infections. The technique is widely used in research and clinical settings and is often one of the first steps in the diagnosis of diseases.

It has a progressive and a regressive procedure, which allows for differentiated staining of the samples.

- Cresyl Violet

Cresyl violet staining is a histological staining technique that is commonly used to visualize and differentiate various types of neural cells in tissue sections. It is a type of basic dye that **stains acidic structures**, such as nucleic acids and proteins, a violet color.

- Bodian-Luxol

Bodian-Luxol staining is a histological staining technique used to **visualize myelin** (stains in blue) in tissue samples, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). The technique was developed by the neurologist and neuropathologist Bernhard Bodian and the chemist Franz Luxol in the mid-20th century.

- Kluver-Barrera ([[#^footnote-5|Comment Unknown Author 5]])

Kluver-Barrera staining, also known as Luxol fast blue-periodic acid-Schiff (LFB-PAS) staining, is a histological staining technique used to visualize myelin (stains in blue) and other neural structures in tissue samples. Neurons are stained pink.

- Wolcke

Staining method that stains myelin sheaths with iron hematoxylin. Stains astrocytes.

- Bielschowsky

Uses silver.

**Non-specific Techniques**

Masson’s trichromium, Verhöeff, Perls, PAS – periodic acid-schiff, Fontana Masson, Gomori Reticulina, Gomori Fungos, Oil red O, **Congo Red**. Immunohistochemistry is now one of the most employed techniques.

### Appendix on Histological Methodology

#### Muscle

Collected with a needle or surgically, usually from the deltoid muscle. Different samples are used for different techniques (usually 5 samples).

Formol and paraformaldehyde (PFA) are both tissue preservers used for the same objective but with different properties. Additionally, formol can’t be used as an alternative to isopentane because the former inhibits enzymatic activity. Isopentane itself is cooled in liquid nitrogen and allows for instant freezing of the sample and therefore prevents tissue damage. Glutaraldehyde is a fixator used for electron microscopy.

Figure 12. Pros and cons of the main types of tissue embedding mediums.

After treatment and freezing of the samples, these are cut using specific machines like the cryostat. Finally, the desired technique is applied to the tissue.

#### Nerves (PNS)

Biopsy from the sural nerve. It is sectioned in 2 portions – one in formol for later paraffin fixation and the other in glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy.

#### Nervous Tissue (CNS)

For preserved tissue, the usual procedure is very similar to standard histological procedures. Fixation with 10% formol, processing with increasingly concentrated alcohol, passing later to xylol ([paraffin is soluble in xylol](https://www.nsh.org/blogs/michael-gubler/2019/07/16/xylene-substitutes)); then follows embedding, cutting, coloration and visualization.

**Extemporaneous exams** are easier and faster to perform, and the samples allow for the making of several smears. The procedure consists of fixation in cold acetone (-20ºC) for 5 minutes, followed by treatment with 70% alcohol and distilled water; afterwards the coloration is applied, the section is dried and mounted.

For histological studies of the whole encephalon, the procedure is to embed the encephalon in formol for 2-6 weeks.

### Appendix on Microscopy

#### Light Microscopy

Used for the Golgi Staining technique.

#### Electron Microscopy

There are two main types of electron microscope – the transmission EM (TEM) and the scanning EM (SEM).

**Negative stain EM** refers to the practice of applying a heavy metal salt stain to a sample for observation. The stain enhances contrast and allows for initial visualization of specimens. It is used in electron microscopy.

### Neuroimaging

Resources:

- Snell, p.51.

#### X-rays

Röntgen discovered x-rays in 1895 by using a cathode ray tube. This device led to the discovery of some properties of these rays: that it was negatively charged, travelled in a straight line and was made of particles capable of transferring kinetic energy ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXOeehVTcRA)).

X-rays were first used in clinical practice to check the presence of intracerebral tumours. Schüller is considered the “father” of neuroradiology and wrote the Röntgen-diagnostik der Erkrankungen des Kopfes (Radiology of Diseases of the Head) in 1912. In contemporary neurology, clinical use of x-ray is very limited and useful only for cranial fractures and indirect diagnosis.

#### Ventriculography (i); Myelography (ii); Angiography (iii).

1. Developed by Walter Dandy in 1918 using air as a contrasting agent.
2. Developed by Siccard by 1922, utilizing iodine as a contrasting agent.
3. Application of a contrast product – iodine. It was firstly developed by Egas Moniz in 1927.

#### Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

See PET on the functional neuroimaging section.

#### Computed Tomography Scan (CT scan)

Developed by Godfrey Hounsfield in 1971. It utilizes x-rays and it is analysed by degrees of densities: Air, fat, and water – hypodense; Calcifications and bone – hyperdense.

#### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) is a spectroscopic technique based on re-orientation of atomic nuclei with non-zero nuclear spins in an external magnetic field. It is used to study the physical, chemical, and biological properties of matter. It is more useful for molecular neuroscience.

#### Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

It measures degrees of intensities. Different MRI techniques can be distinguished by the strength of the magnetic field produced by the MRI machine, which is measure in Tesla (T).

![MRI coils, gradients, magnet](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/MRI coils gradients magnet.gif>)

Figure 13. Representative cross-section of a superconducting scanner showing nested arrangement of "coils". Both superconducting and resistive shim coils are shown. Two different types of patient coils are also illustrated: a receive only spine coil array, and a transmit/receive knee coil.

**Gradients** are sets of electromagnets located behind the walls of MR scanners used for spatial encoding and signal generation. Gradients distort the main magnetic field in a predictable fashion, causing the resonance frequency of protons to vary as a function of position. The strength of the magnetic fields generated by gradients are less than 3% of the main magnetic field (Bo), so their static effects are of no concern. Rather, it is the time rate of change of these gradient fields (dB/dt) that poses potential safety issues for MR imaging.

Figure 14. Another view of the MRI machine.

An **MRI sequence** is a particular setting of radiofrequency pulses and gradients, resulting in a particular image appearance. The T1 and T2 weighting can also be described as MRI sequences.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 13.png>)

Figure 15. Pulse sequence is the basis of MRI. RF stands for radio frequency.

A single RF pulse generates a **free induction decay (FID)**, but two successive RF pulses produce a spin echo (SE). The time between the middle of the first RF pulse and the peak of the spin echo is called the echo time (TE).

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 14.png>)

Figure 16. Creation of a spin echo. by two RF pulses. The first RF pulse generates an FID, while the second pulse generates the SE. The echo time (TE) is twice the interpulse interval.

Different tissues will show different magnetic properties and so different techniques in MRI data acquisition can highlight different biological structures. Each tissue returns to its equilibrium state after excitation by the independent relaxation processes of **T1** (spin-lattice; that is, magnetization in the same direction as the static magnetic field) and **T2** (spin-spin; transverse to the static magnetic field). To create a T1-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to recover before measuring the MR signal by changing the repetition time (TR). This image weighting is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex, identifying fatty tissue, characterizing focal liver lesions, and in general, obtaining morphological information, as well as for post-contrast imaging. To create a T2-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to decay before measuring the MR signal by changing the echo time (TE). This image weighting is useful for detecting edema and inflammation, revealing white matter lesions, and assessing zonal anatomy in the prostate and uterus.

### Functional Neuroimaging

#### γ-camera/single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)

It collects energy coming from γ-decay. It allows for a 3D reconstruction of the brain since the machine moves around the patient. It has a spatial resolution of ~10 mm, which is dependent on the energies of the γ-rays. One example of utilized neuropharmaceutical is the 99mTc-HMPAO, which is a lipophilic agent and crosses the BBB. Furthermore, it is metabolized intracellularly which inhibits its diffusion to outside the cell; its intracellular accumulation is proportional the blood flow of the specific area. 123I-Ioflupano has affinity for DAT transporters.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 15.png>)

#### Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

It captures γ-rays that come from β-decay. It also allows for the 3D reconstruction of the brain and has a resolution of ~5 mm, due to the characteristics of β-decay. One important radiopharmaceutical is the 18F-FDG, which is an analog of glucose uncapable of being metabolized; it accumulates in active neurons. Many radiotracers utilized in PET are useful for the targeting of AD hallmarks, such as β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Examples include: 11C-PiB, 18F-Florbetaben, 18F-Flortaucipir, etc…

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 16.png>)

#### Functional MRI (fMRI)

Developed by Seiji Ogawa in 1990. The concept behind fMRI is that of measuring brain activity by measuring changes in blood flow. This can be achieved by the different magnetic properties of hemoglobin when bound to oxygen and when unbounded. This is due to the fact that oxygen surrounds the iron molecule and interferes with its attraction to the magnetic field created by the machine. The ratio between oxihemoglobin and hemoglobin at any point determines the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, which represents 1 voxel (~3x3x3 mm).

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 17.png>)

According to the oxygenation hypothesis, changes in oxygen usage in regional cerebral blood flow during cognitive or behavioral activity can be associated with the regional neurons as being directly related to the cognitive or behavioral tasks being attended. However, even though that the fMRI signal is linear on relation to brain activity, cognition is not linearly correlated with brain activity. Furthermore, since adjacent blood vessels also dilate in a specific activated area, there is less spatial resolution. Furthermore, temporal resolution is of ~3-5 seconds, which hinders any kind of inference about the type of brain activity (a train of smaller potentials or one big, evoked potential) represented in the fMRI signal. Furthermore, fMRI can be utilized to analyse functional connectivity in the brain.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment.jpeg>)

Figure 18. Examples of results from one fMRI study.

Functional MRI can be readily performed using a standard 1.5T clinical MRI magnet, although an increasing fraction of studies are now performed on higher field (3-4.5T) machines for improved SNR and resolution. fMRI studies are capable of producing spatial resolutions as high as 1-3 mm.

**TR** and **TE** are basic pulse sequence parameters and stand for repetition time and echo time respectively. They are typically measured in milliseconds (ms).

The echo time (TE) represents the time from the center of the RF-pulse to the center of the echo. For pulse sequences with multiple echoes between each RF pulse, several echo times may be defined and are commonly noted TE1, TE2, TE3, etc.

The repetition time (TR) is the length of time between corresponding consecutive points on a repeating series of pulses and echoes. The TR dictates how often a particular brain slice is excited and allowed to lose its magnetization. TRs could vary from the very short (500 ms) to the very long (3 s).

Functional MRI has many different data types which must be explicated in the context of computational data analysis, especially in relation to the **BIDS convention**. The data types include:

1. _func_ (task based and resting state functional MRI)
2. _dwi_ (diffusion weighted imaging)
3. _fmap_ (field inhomogeneity mapping data such as field maps)
4. _anat_ (structural imaging such as T1, T2, PD, and so on)
5. _perf_ (perfusion)

#### Arterial spin labeling (ASL)

**Arterial spin labeling (ASL)** is a non-invasive MRI technique that allows for quantitative measurement of cerebral perfusion.

#### Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)

Diffusion imaging is an advanced MRI technique based on optimised pulse sequences, which permits the quantification of the diffusion characteristics of water molecules inside biological tissues (Le Bihan and Breton, 1985). Given that cerebral white matter contains axons, and that water molecules diffuse more freely along axons than across them (Moseley et al., 1990), it is possible to obtain in vivo estimates of white matter fibre orientation by measuring the diffusivity of water molecules along different directions (Basser et al., 1994). Information from Catani, Dell’Acqua, and Thiebaut de Schotten 2013.

#### Functional Ultrasound (fUS)

Better application in newborns, since the fontanelles allow for the passage of ultrasound waves more readily. It can also be applied in adults, using other methods. Its spatial resolution can reach the 5 µm mark. It can be used for observation of red blood cells in the vessels.

#### Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is an optical brain monitoring technique which uses near-infrared spectroscopy for the purpose of functional neuroimaging. Therefore, it is a type of transcranial optical imaging techniques. See more.

### Appendix on radioactivity

Becquerel found in 1896 spontaneous radiation emitted by uranium salts. Later, Pierre and Marie Currie described Polonium and Radium, in 1898, and postulate a theory of radiation.

Radioisotopes are isotopes which naturally release energy by the nucleus, either in particles or electromagnetic radiation, due to decay as a result of their instability. The stability of an isotope depends on the neutron-proton ratio and the size of the isotope, as can be observed in the image below.

One very important feature of radioisotopes is that they preserve the chemical properties when decaying occurs, albeit the physical properties change. The principal of radiotracer thus bases itself on this property and consists in the use of a radiopharmaceutical (radioisotope + biological molecule), which participates in biological processes but does not interfere with them. There are 30+ types of radioisotopes utilized in clinical settings.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 19.png>)

Figure 22. In this figure, each dot is an isotope, and we can say that all the stable isotopes are located in a region that we call “belt of stability”. If we analyse the diagram, we see that up to Z = 20, the neutron to proton ratio is 1. However, for Z > 20, the number of neutrons seems to be higher than that of protons for a stable isotope. If a nucleus has a very high neutron to proton ratio, then it lies above the belt of stability and hence such nuclei tend to decay in order to lower the n:p ratio. In this process, a neutron may decay to a proton, electron, and an anti-electron neutrino particle (beta- decay). Now, a new isotope is produced that has a lowered n:p ratio and hence is more stable than the earlier nucleus. For instance, consider the decay of O-19. It has 8 protons and 11 neutrons. The n:p is greater than 1. It decays to F-19, which has 9 protons and 10 neutrons. So you see that n:p ratio is lower than before, so it has higher stability. Similarly, the nucleus with a very low neutron to proton ratio (the one with significantly higher number of protons than neutrons) lie below belt of stability, and they decay through beta plus decay where a positron and an electron neutrino are emitted. This results in an increased n:p ratio. E.g. the decay of F-18. It has 9 protons and 9 neutrons. Now you may ask why would F-18 decay if it has 9 protons and 9 neutrons such that the n:p ratio is 1 and that is exactly what we wanted. It turns out that the reason can be explained by nuclear shell model where nucleus tends to stabilize itself by its tendency to rearrange the number of protons and neutrons to what is popularly called as “the magic numbers”. It decays to O-18, which has 8 protons and 10 neutrons. It so turns out that 8 is a magic number. And hence, the nuclear shell is complete and thus, more stable. This exactly explains why even proton-even neutron nuclei are more stable than odd-odd or odd-even or even-odd nuclei. When nuclei are both even in numbers, they completely pair up with each other and hence, nuclear binding energy is higher. Let me be clear though, n:p ratio is thus, not the only factor that determines the stability of a nucleus. There are other factors like whether the number of protons and neutrons are odd or even, and whether the nucleus is “doubly magic” (meaning that the number of protons and neutrons are one of 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126(only for neutrons)). The concept of seeking idea about stability through n:p ratio is the prime idea of the liquid drop model, while the concept of magic numbers was the outcome of nuclear shell model. Source: Wikipedia.

There are several types of decay; these depend on the neutron-proton ration and are represented in the image below.

![Chart  Description automatically generated](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Chart  Description automatically generated.png>)

Figure 23. Types of decay.

#### β-decay and γ-decay

In β-decay, a proton decays into a neutron and releases its charge in the form of a positron/β ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) (anti-particle of the electron). The positron will then collide with an electron and release its energy in the form of 2 γ-rays of the same energy which travel in the opposite direction to each other (180º angle).

In γ-decay there is no ejected particle from the nucleus but only release of energy in the form of 1 γ-ray which is more erratic in its energy value.

#### Concepts

**Imaging phantom**, or simply phantom, is a specially designed object that is scanned or imaged in the field of medical imaging to evaluate, analyse, and tune the performance of various imaging devices. A phantom is more readily available and provides more consistent results than the use of a living subject or cadaver, and likewise avoids subjecting a living subject to direct risk. Phantoms were originally employed for use in 2D x-ray based imaging techniques such as radiography or fluoroscopy, though more recently phantoms with desired imaging characteristics have been developed for 3D techniques such as SPECT, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, PET, and other imaging methods or modalities.
