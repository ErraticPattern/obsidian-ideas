### Brain structures
If we are to believe the [[Brain|brain]] is a structure which, seen in the human species, is the result of an evolution from more primitive brains then, surely, its anatomical features are no result of chance and convey an optimal structure for our phenomenological experience, whose purpose is to aid in the survival of the individual.
To understand the brain also demands an understanding of Man and the different degrees of life which we can observe and study in nature.
A good start would perhaps be the study of _[[C. elegans]],_ whose connectome is completed; its exact number of neurons and connections is known. However, primarily, it would be extremely insightful to understand how a circuit of signal transmitting cells could be created. Is there a precursor cell to the neuron? One perhaps slower in its signal transmission but easier to be created. Perhaps this is to be sought in the embryological nature of the neuron – the ectoderm. It does make sense that the outer most layer of cells be the one transducing signals. Then, it would not be far-fetched that some ectodermal cells specialized in communication, one that could result in fast muscular movement. In this case, one would have basic circuits with predetermined responses. To check this, I must understand better the relationship between neural and ectodermal cells.

### On human brain anatomy
As anatomical brain structures are given in more detail and complexity, observation is not enough. It is necessary to employ more sophisticated imaging techniques. It is thus that some of the information below I must take for granted. I do not know how the many connections between the hypothalamus and the other structures were discovered, since it is hard to distinguish the tracts in these areas. Similarly, nuclei functions must also be taken for granted. I do know that to try and understand every step of the evolution of this field is near impossible; however, it would be extremely insightful if, besides anatomical knowledge, I could also understand what effect each disease has on the huma brain anatomy. For if we are to begin the study of mind from the beginning, we must start with that which is capable of being observed. It is thus that correlation, from all available cases, between behaviour and structure, mind and brain, effect, and cause, led knowledge of the mind to increase throughout history. It is of course also necessary to understand the presuppositions made in these claims.
