##### Precentral Gyrus

Figure 27. The motor and sensory homunculi. The precentral gyrus encodes the motor homunculus. Output from the motor cortex is organized in similar fashion. The amount of cortical surface dedicated to a part of the body is related to the degree of motor control of that part. Thus, in humans, much of the motor cortex is dedicated to controlling the muscles of the fingers and the muscles related to speech.

##### The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a prefrontal cortex region in the frontal lobes of the brain which is involved in the cognitive process of decision-making. In non-human primates it consists of the association cortex areas Brodmann area 11, 12 and 13; in humans it consists of Brodmann area 10, 11 and 47 ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitofrontal_cortex)).

##### BA 44 (pars opercularis)

Brodmann area 44 (BA 44), also known as **pars opercularis** (of the inferior frontal gyrus), is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Situated just anterior to premotor cortex (BA6) and on the lateral surface, inferior to BA9. It refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. It is associated with **syntax**.

#### Parietal (sensorial and language)

The parietal lobe can be divided into two functional regions. One region involves sensation and perception, and the other region is concerned with integrating sensory input, primarily with the visual system. Moreover, the postcentral gyrus is responsible for somatosensation. This region receives input from the somatosensory relays of the thalamus and represents information about touch and sense (Kim et al., 2010).

##### Postcentral gyrus

![Diagram  Description automatically generated](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Diagram  Description automatically generated 1.png>)

Figure 29. The area of cortex dedicated to processing sensory information (postcentral gyrus) from a particular part of the body is not proportional to the mass of the body part but instead reflects the density of sensory receptors in that part. Thus, sensory input from the lips and hands occupies more area of cortex than, say, that from the elbow.

##### Retrosplenial Cortex (RSC)

It is 100 years since Brodmann delineated the human RSC (areas 29 and 30) within the posterior cingulate region. Early studies characterized the memory impairments following RSC damage as disconnection effects resulting from the interruption of pathways from the hippocampus to either the anterior thalamic nuclei or the frontal cortex.

It does seem incontrovertible that the RSC is important for spatial navigation. Perhaps the biggest challenge lies in linking the RSC’s role in navigation with its involvement in episodic memory, imagination and thinking about the future while being precise about its specific contributions. Furthermore, the RSC is involved in contextual mapping of permanent landmarks, and orientation relative thereto.

##### Fusiform gyrus

Also known as the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus. It is part of the temporal lobe and occipital lobe in Brodmann area 37.

##### Lingual Gyrus

Figure 34. Lingual gyrus location.

The lingual gyrus is a tongue-shaped structure that lies on the medial aspect of the occipital lobe along the inferomedial (tentorial) surface. It is a brain structure that is linked to processing vision, especially related to letters. It is thought to also play a role in analysis of logical conditions (i.e., logical order of events) and encoding visual memories. It is named after its shape, which is somewhat similar to a tongue. Contrary to the name, the region has little to do with speech. It is believed that a hypermetabolism of the lingual gyrus is associated with visual snow ([[#^footnote-6|Comment Unknown Author 6]]).

There are 3 types of fibers:

- Commissural (inter-hemispherical)
- Association (intra-hemispherical)
- Projection (outer-hemispherical)
