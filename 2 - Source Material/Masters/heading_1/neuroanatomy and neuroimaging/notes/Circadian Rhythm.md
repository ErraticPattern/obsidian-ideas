### Circadian Rhythm

Process S (or Process H) refers to the homeostatic sleep pressure that builds up over time spent awake. Process C is a sleep-independent process that reflects our internal daily rhythms kept in sync with the Earth's near 24-h cycle through the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN antagonizes homeostatic sleep pressure.

The timing of sleep is regulated by many factors, the most important being light. Other factors include melatonin, temperature, meals, and social interactions. Melatonin acts on the SCN. If no stimuli are given to the circadian rhythm, then the cycle will be advance 1 hour in time after each day due to the internal cycle being a little bit over 24 hours.
