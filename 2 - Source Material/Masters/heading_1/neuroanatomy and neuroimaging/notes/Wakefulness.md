### Electrophysiology

Wakefulness is characterized by >50% α if eyelids are closed.

N1 is characterized by >50% θ signals.

Sleep spindles are bursts of neural oscillatory activity that are generated by interplay of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and other thalamic nuclei during N2-stage sleep in a frequency range of ~11 to 16 Hz (usually 12–14 Hz) with a duration of 0.5 seconds or greater (usually 0.5–1.5 seconds).

A K-complex is a waveform that may be seen on an electroencephalogram (EEG). It occurs during N2 sleep. It is the "largest event in healthy human EEG". They are more frequent in the first sleep cycles.

N3 is characterized by >20% δ signals.

REM is characterized by high-frequency waves.
