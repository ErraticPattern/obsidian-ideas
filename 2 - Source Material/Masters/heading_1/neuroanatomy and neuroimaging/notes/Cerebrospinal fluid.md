# CSF

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is somewhat similar to that of blood plasma and interstitial fluid. It is present in the ventricular system within the CNS and in the subarachnoid space surrounding the CNS. It bathes both the external and internal surfaces of the brain and spinal cord. In an adult, the total volume of CSF is about 150 ml, out of which only 30 ml is in the ventricular system and remainder in the subarachnoid space.
