Figure 29. The area of cortex dedicated to processing sensory information (postcentral gyrus) from a particular part of the body is not proportional to the mass of the body part but instead reflects the density of sensory receptors in that part. Thus, sensory input from the lips and hands occupies more area of cortex than, say, that from the elbow.
