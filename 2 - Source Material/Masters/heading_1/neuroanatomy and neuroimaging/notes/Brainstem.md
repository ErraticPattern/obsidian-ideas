### Brainstem

Functions of brainstem: allow for ascending and descending tracts, communicating between spinal cord, cerebrum, and cerebellum; contains nucleus of the cranial nerves (from III to XII); it contains important reflex centers associated with the control of respiration and the cardiovascular system and with the control of consciousness.

It contains: (1) Medulla oblongata; (2) Pons; (3) Mesencephalon.

#### Medulla Oblongata

It is continuous with the spinal cord (foramen magnum marks separation); it shares the anterior median fissure and posterior sulcus of the spinal cord. Posteriorly, it contains the gracile and cuneate tubercules, produced by the respective nuclei, which receive the respective fasciculi from the spinal cord.

Figure 59. Connections between the NTS and other major autonomic brain regions. The caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dorsal vagal nucleus, DVN), nucleus ambiguus (NA), and supramedullary sites, including the hypothalamus, are reciprocally connected to the NTS. The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) receives monosynaptic inputs from the commissural NTS. The DVN, NA, and RVLM are major efferent pathways of the parasympathetic and sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.
