# Hypothalamus

Controls autonomic (Preoptic and anterior areas – parasympathetic response/Lateral and posterior areas – sympathetic response), limbic and endocrine functions.

**Nuclei** (anterior to posterior/periventricular to medial to lateral (in relation to fornix)):

**Lateral side ([[#^footnote-8|Comment Unknown Author 8]]):**

The large nerve cells throughout the lateral zone are relatively sparse and collectively constitute the lateral nucleus. This nucleus occupies the whole anteroposterior extent of the hypothalamus.

I just had a lecture (18/01/2024) where the authors of experiments related to spinal cord injuries and its rehabilitation through the use of stimulation devices showed that the lateral hypothalamus is a region implicated in the motor control of gait. It is so because it connects with a specific subtype of neuron (classified genetically based on RNA) which is known to be involved in the control of the gait (mechanics of gait). These neurons are strengthened upon stimulation while other types of neurons are inhibited, thereby reducing spasms and increasing motor control in patients with spinal cord injuries.

**Medial side:**

- Anterior

Preoptic (telencephalic origin) – Parasympathetic NS control and synthesis of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) – released into portal system. Ventral lateral preoptic (VLPO) regulates sleep.

Supraoptic – synthetises vasopressin.

Paraventricular nucleus – synthetises oxytocin.

Periventricular nucleus

Anterior

Suprachiasmatic

- Medial (Tuberal) – Adenohypophysis regulation through portal system. These release releasing hormones and release-inhibiting hormones.

## Regions associated with hypothalamus

Optic chiasm

Optic nerve

Tuber Cinereum (Layer of hypothalamic grey matter that forms the floor of the 3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) ventricle and descends to form the infundibulum) + Infundibulum (name of the hollow structure created by Tuber Cinereum) + Lamina Terminalis (thin sheet of grey matter) = Pituitary Stalk; this leads to the adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis.
