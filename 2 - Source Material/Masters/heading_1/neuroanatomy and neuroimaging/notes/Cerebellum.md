### Cerebellum

Located in the posterior fossa, below the tentorium cerebelli. It has 2 hemispheres and the Vermis in between. It contains the anterior lobe (spinocerebellum), posterior lobe (cerebrocerebellum) and flocullonodular lobe (vestibulocerebellum). Each lobe is divided into lobules and these into folium. It seems that the motor representation of the motor body is not inverted.

It contains internal nuclei: Dentate nucleus, Interposed nuclei (Globose and Emboliform nuclei) and the Fastigial nucleus – these are the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN).

Functionally it is divided into Vermis, the paravermis and lateral hemispheres.

#### Cortical layers

- Molecular
- Stellate cells (inhibits PCs)
- Basket cells (inhibits PCs)
- Purkinje Cell
- Purkinje cells (PCs)
- Bergmann Glia
- Granular
- Golgi cells (these inhibit the granular cells)
- Granular cells (only excitatory neuron from cerebellum)

#### Afferent connections

- Climbing fibers (Each fiber establishes multiple synapses with only one Purkinje cell, as well as with the stellate and basket cells) – these come from the olivo-cerebellar tracts (from inferior olivary nucleus); these are monosynaptic.

- Mossy fibers (Synapse with cells from the granular layers; granule cells give off parallel fibers which synapse with PCs; 1 PC to lots of different granule cells); therefore these are polysynaptic.

- Multilayered fibers (From noradrenergic and serotoninergic projections from the brainstem (locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei) and histaminergic projections from the hypothalamus – these don’t terminate in the PC layer.

#### Efferent connections

The DCN receives input exclusively from Purkinje cells (inhibitory); the DCN only gives excitatory efferent fibers.
