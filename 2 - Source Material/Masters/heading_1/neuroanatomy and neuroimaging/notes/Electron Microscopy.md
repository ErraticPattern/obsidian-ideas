# Electron Microscopy

There are two main types of electron microscope â€“ the transmission EM (TEM) and the scanning EM (SEM).

**Negative stain EM** refers to the practice of applying a heavy metal salt stain to a sample for observation. The stain enhances contrast and allows for initial visualization of specimens. It is used in electron microscopy.
