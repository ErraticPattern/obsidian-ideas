### Limbic system

Emotion, drive, and memory as its main functions – It must then be responsible for the association of memories with emotion. The visceral responses following activities in limbic system are expressed through hypothalamus by way of autonomic nervous system.

#### Pericallosal ([[#^footnote-7|Comment Unknown Author 7]])

Indusium griseum (vestigial) -> Gyrus fasciolaris (around splenium of corpus callosum) -> Dentate Gyrus -> Uncus (All this constitutes the thing layer of grey matter around the corpus callosum).

**Medial and lateral longitudinal striae** (fibers) are found on either side of the midline of the **Indusium griseum**.

#### Subcallosal gyri

The subcallosal gyrus (paraterminal gyrus, peduncle of the corpus callosum) is a narrow lamina on the medial surface of the hemisphere in front of the lamina terminalis, behind the **parolfactory area**, and below the rostrum of the corpus callosum. It is continuous around the genu of the corpus callosum with the indusium griseum.

#### Cingulate gyri

The cingulate gyrus (CG) is involved in adaptive control of behavior and conflict monitoring. It is not fully developed in adolescents which might contribute to the latter’s observed poor decision-making capabilities. It is known as the satisfaction centre of the brain.

#### Parahippocampal gyrus

It contains the usual 6 cortical layers.

#### Dentate gyrus

Situated between the fimbria and parahippocampal gyrus.

Dentate gyrus has 3 layers:

- Molecular layer
- Granular layer
- Polymorphic layer

[[Hippocampus]]

#### Amygdaloid nucleus

Emotion, mostly of fear and anger, to stimuli. Connects posteriorly to the stria terminalis and connects to hypothalamus, thalamus (stria medullaris connects to habenula) and septal area

#### Septal area

Pleasure zone in brain of rats

#### Nucleus Accumbens

#### Fibers

- Alveus -> Fimbria -> Crus of Fornix -> Fornix (afferent and, mostly, efferent pathways of [[hippocampus]]); fornix is connected by the commissure of the fornix
- Stria terminalis
- Mammillothalamic tract

#### Connections
