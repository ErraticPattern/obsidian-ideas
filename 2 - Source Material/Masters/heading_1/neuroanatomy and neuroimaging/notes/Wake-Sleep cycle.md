### Anatomy and Physiology of the Wake-Sleep cycle

Early sleep investigation showed that at the level of the diencephalon-mesencephalic junction area, anterior lesions caused insomnia while posterior lesions caused hypersomnia. These findings were then associated with specific nuclei which regulate the wake-sleep cycle. Although the Kleine-Levin syndrome seems to be associated with hypothalamic function dysregulation, its etiology is still largely unknown.

**Wakefulness** is regulated by brainstem pathways, consisting of aminergic, cholinergic and orexinergic signals. If the orexinergic ([[#^footnote-12|Comment Unknown Author 12]]) system fails, then the patient will develop narcolepsy ([[#^footnote-13|Comment Unknown Author 13]]).

Figure 74. | A schematic drawing showing some key components of the ascending arousal system. A major input to the relay and reticular nuclei of the thalamus (yellow pathway) originates from cholinergic (ACh) cell groups in the upper pons, the pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT). These inputs facilitate thalamocortical transmission. A second pathway (red) activates the cerebral cortex to facilitate the processing of inputs from the thalamus. This arises from neurons in the monoaminergic cell groups, including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) containing histamine (His), the A10 cell group containing dopamine (DA), the dorsal and median raphe nuclei containing serotonin (5-HT), and the locus coeruleus (LC) containing noradrenaline (NA). This pathway also receives contributions from peptidergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) containing orexin (ORX) or melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and from basal forebrain (BF) neurons that contain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or ACh. Note that all of these ascending pathways traverse the region at the junction of the brainstem and forebrain where von Economo noted that lesions caused profound sleepiness (Saper et al., 2005).

**Sleep** is regulated mainly by the hypothalamic nucleus VLPO. VLPO regulates sleep by inhibiting the action of the wakefulness pathways.

Figure 75. Inhibitory action of VLPO over the wakefulness pathway. A schematic drawing to show the key projections of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) to the main components of the ascending arousal system. It includes the monoaminergic cell groups (red) such as the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), the A10 cell group, the raphe cell groups and the locus coeruleus (LC). It also innervates neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA; green), including the perifornical (PeF) orexin (ORX) neurons, and interneurons in the cholinergic (ACh) cell groups (yellow), the pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT). Note that the VLPO neurons lie within the region outlined by von Economo for the anterior hypothalamic lesion that caused insomnia. 5-HT, serotonin; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; gal, galanin; NA, noradrenaline; His, histamine.
