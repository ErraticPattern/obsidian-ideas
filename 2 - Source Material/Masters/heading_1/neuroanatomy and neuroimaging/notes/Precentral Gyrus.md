Figure 27. The motor and sensory homunculi. The precentral gyrus encodes the motor homunculus. Output from the motor cortex is organized in similar fashion. The amount of cortical surface dedicated to a part of the body is related to the degree of motor control of that part. Thus, in humans, much of the motor cortex is dedicated to controlling the muscles of the fingers and the muscles related to speech.
