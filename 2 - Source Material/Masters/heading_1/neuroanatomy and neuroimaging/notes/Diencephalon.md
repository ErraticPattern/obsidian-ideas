### Diencephalon

#### Hypothalamus

Controls autonomic (Preoptic and anterior areas – parasympathetic response/Lateral and posterior areas – sympathetic response), limbic and endocrine functions.

**Nuclei** (anterior to posterior/periventricular to medial to lateral (in relation to fornix)):

**Lateral side ([[#^footnote-8|Comment Unknown Author 8]]):**

The large nerve cells throughout the lateral zone are relatively sparse and collectively constitute the lateral nucleus. This nucleus occupies the whole anteroposterior extent of the hypothalamus.

I just had a lecture (18/01/2024) where the authors of experiments related to spinal cord injuries and its rehabilitation through the use of stimulation devices showed that the lateral hypothalamus is a region implicated in the motor control of gait. It is so because it connects with a specific subtype of neuron (classified genetically based on RNA) which is known to be involved in the control of the gait (mechanics of gait). These neurons are strengthened upon stimulation while other types of neurons are inhibited, thereby reducing spasms and increasing motor control in patients with spinal cord injuries.

**Medial side:**

- Anterior

Preoptic (telencephalic origin) – Parasympathetic NS control and synthesis of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) – released into portal system. Ventral lateral preoptic (VLPO) regulates sleep.

Supraoptic – synthetises vasopressin.

Paraventricular nucleus – synthetises oxytocin.

Periventricular nucleus

Suprachiasmatic

##### Regions associated with hypothalamus

Optic chiasm

Optic nerve

Tuber Cinereum (Layer of hypothalamic grey matter that forms the floor of the 3 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) ventricle and descends to form the infundibulum) + Infundibulum (name of the hollow structure created by Tuber Cinereum) + Lamina Terminalis (thin sheet of grey matter) = Pituitary Stalk; this leads to the adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis.

#### Thalamus

Functions as the gateway of the cortex. It integrates every type of sensory information, except smell. The fiber connections have been established, and, following removal of the cortex, the thalamus can appreciate crude sensations. However, the cerebral cortex is required for the interpretation of sensations based on past experiences. Very interesting! – (see page 395 of Snell’s).

##### Nuclei

- Anterior

Anterior nucleus involved with the limbic lobe and cingulate gyrus (Papez circuit).

- Medial

Dorsomedial nucleus and other smaller nuclei. The first connects heavily with the frontal lobe, responsible for behaviour and motivation, and hypothalamus. Integrates sensory information, visceral and somatic.

- Lateral (anterior – motor cortex/ posterior – sensory cortex)
- Ventral

VA, VL (these two connect with basal ganglia are motor related), VP – VPL and VPM (divided into 2 and sense related)

- Dorsal

LD (limbic system with anterior nucleus), LP and Pulvinar (last two heavily related to integration of visual information)

- Internal medullary lamina

intralaminar nuclei (connects with reticular formation through the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS))

- Interthalamic connection

midline nuclei (connect to reticular formation)

- Periphery of thalamus

**Reticular nucleus** (Thalamic reticular nucleus) is a thin layer of nerve cells sandwiched between the external medullary lamina and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. It contains cells that have spontaneous rhythmic oscillatory activity, which generate sleep spindles.

**Medial geniculate body** (auditory pathway).

**Lateral geniculate body** (visual pathway).

##### White matter

- The thalamus is covered on its superior surface by a thin layer of white matter, called the stratum zonale, and on Its lateral surface by another layer, the external medullary lamina.
- Internal medullary lamina (Y-shaped, divides thalamus and contains some nuclei).
