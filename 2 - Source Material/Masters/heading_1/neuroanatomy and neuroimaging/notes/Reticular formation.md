# Reticular formation
The reticular formation consists of a deeply placed continuous network of nerve cells and fibers that extend from the spinal cord through the medulla, the pons, the midbrain, the subthalamus, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus.

Multiple ascending pathways carrying sensory Information to higher centers are channelled through the reticular formation, which, in tum, projects this information to different parts of the [[cerebral cortex]], causing a sleeping person to awaken. The question is if it simply contributes to consciousness by being a pathway for the cortex or if itself creates consciousness.

Divided into columns:
