# Cerebrum
It is composed of 2 hemispheres, divided by the longitudinal fissure. It contains a cortex (grey matter), with 6 cortical layers, in depth. The cortex can be divided into lobes.

# Notes
#### Frontal (executive functions and motor control)

[[Precentral Gyrus]]

[[Orbitofrontal cortex]]

[[Pars opercularis]]

#### Parietal (sensorial and language)

The parietal lobe can be divided into two functional regions. One region involves sensation and perception, and the other region is concerned with integrating sensory input, primarily with the visual system. Moreover, the postcentral gyrus is responsible for somatosensation. This region receives input from the somatosensory relays of the thalamus and represents information about touch and sense (Kim et al., 2010).

[[Postcentral gyrus]]

[[Retrosplenial Cortex]]

[[Precuneus]]

#### Temporal (hearing, smell, and short-term memory)

[[Insula]]

[[Fusiform gyrus]]
#### Occipital (vision)

[[Lingual Gyrus]]
[[V1 area]]

#### Fibers

There are 3 types of fibers:

- Commissural (inter-hemispherical)
- Association (intra-hemispherical)
- Projection (outer-hemispherical)

[[Corpus Callosum]]

[[Anterior Commissure]]

[[Posterior Commissure]]
