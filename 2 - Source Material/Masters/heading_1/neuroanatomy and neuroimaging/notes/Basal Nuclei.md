### Basal Nuclei

The caudate nucleus and the putamen form the main sites for receiving input to the basal nuclei. The globus pallidus forms the major site from which the output leaves the basal nuclei. Unlike many other parts of the nervous system concerned with motor control, the basal nuclei have no direct input or output connections with the spinal cord. In what way is this relevant?

#### Corpus striatum (Lentiform nucleus + caudate)

Divided embryologically into:

- Paleostriatum
- Neostriatum

Divided functionally into:

- Dorsal striatum

Composed of the lentiform nucleus ([[#^footnote-10|Comment Unknown Author 10]]) and caudate nucleus.

- Ventral Striatum

Composed of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle.

Figure 51. Basal ganglia connections.

Taken from Snell’s. It is important to notice how the striatum seems like a correcting structure or an overseer, i.e. computes something which is necessary for coordination of inputs so that correct information goes back to the cortex and then to the effector muscles. It might be that it integrates both sensory and motor information, so that an efficient action can follow. It is perhaps a cousin of the cerebellum; the basal nuclei help compute fine and conscious-required movements while the cerebellum computes the more automatized movements. If there is still crude movement if the motor cortex is destroyed, then it might be that the basal nuclei prepare the fine motor control by a crude movement, that is, completing each other. “In this way, the basal nuclei assist in the regulation of voluntary movement and the learning of motor skills”.

#### Amygdaloid nucleus

#### Claustrum

Thin grey matter band lateral to external capsule and whose function is not well elucidated.

#### Peripheral fibers

- Internal capsule
- External capsule
- Extreme capsule

#### Associated pathways

- Direct pathway – excitation of movement (regulated by the Substantia Nigra – can lead to PD in loss of it)
- Indirect pathway – inhibition of movement (regulated by Striatum – can result in chorea in loss of it)
