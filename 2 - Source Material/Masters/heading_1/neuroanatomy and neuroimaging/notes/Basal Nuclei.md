### Basal Nuclei

The caudate nucleus and the putamen form the main sites for receiving input to the basal nuclei. The globus pallidus forms the major site from which the output leaves the basal nuclei. Unlike many other parts of the nervous system concerned with motor control, the basal nuclei have no direct input or output connections with the spinal cord. In what way is this relevant?

[[Corpus striatum]]

[[Amygdaloid nucleus]]

[[Claustrum]]

#### Peripheral fibers

- [[Internal capsule]]
- [[External capsule]]
- [[Extreme capsule]]

#### Associated pathways

- Direct pathway – excitation of movement (regulated by the Substantia Nigra – can lead to PD in loss of it)
- Indirect pathway – inhibition of movement (regulated by Striatum – can result in chorea in loss of it)
