## Central Nervous System

Figure 10. The neurons of the neocortex are arranged in distinctive layers. The appearance of the neocortex depends on what is used to stain it. The Golgi stain (left) reveals a subset of neuronal cell bodies, axons, and dendritic trees. The Nissl method (middle) shows cell bodies and proximal dendrites. The Weigert stain (right) reveals the pattern of myelinated fibers.

**Specific Techniques**

- [[Hematoxylin & Eosin]]

Hematoxylin is a basic dye that stains acidic structures, such as the nuclei of cells, a blue-purple color. This allows for the visualization of the number, size, shape, and organization of the cells within a tissue sample.

Eosin is an acidic dye that stains basic structures, such as the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, a pink-red color. This allows for the visualization of the cell boundaries and the extracellular components of a tissue sample.

Together, hematoxylin and eosin ([[#^footnote-4|Comment Unknown Author 4]]) staining allows for the visualization of the general morphology and organization of cells within a tissue sample, which can be used to identify and diagnose a variety of diseases, including cancers and infections. The technique is widely used in research and clinical settings and is often one of the first steps in the diagnosis of diseases.

It has a progressive and a regressive procedure, which allows for differentiated staining of the samples.

- [[Cresyl Violet]]

Cresyl violet staining is a histological staining technique that is commonly used to visualize and differentiate various types of neural cells in tissue sections. It is a type of basic dye that **stains acidic structures**, such as nucleic acids and proteins, a violet color.

- [[Bodian-Luxol]]

Bodian-Luxol staining is a histological staining technique used to **visualize myelin** (stains in blue) in tissue samples, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). The technique was developed by the neurologist and neuropathologist Bernhard Bodian and the chemist Franz Luxol in the mid-20th century.

- [[Kluver-Barrera]] ([[#^footnote-5|Comment Unknown Author 5]])

Kluver-Barrera staining, also known as Luxol fast blue-periodic acid-Schiff (LFB-PAS) staining, is a histological staining technique used to visualize myelin (stains in blue) and other neural structures in tissue samples. Neurons are stained pink.

- [[Wolcke]]

Staining method that stains myelin sheaths with iron hematoxylin. Stains astrocytes.

- [[Bielschowsky]]

Uses silver.

**Non-specific Techniques**

[[Masson’s trichromium]], [[Verhöeff]], [[Perls]], PAS – [[periodic acid-schiff]], [[Fontana Masson]], [[Gomori Reticulina]], [[Gomori Fungos]], [[Oil red O]], **[[Congo Red]]**. Immunohistochemistry is now one of the most employed techniques.

# Appendix on Histological Methodology

## Muscle

Collected with a needle or surgically, usually from the [[deltoid muscle]]. Different samples are used for different techniques (usually 5 samples).

[[Formol and paraformaldehyde]] (PFA) are both tissue preservers used for the same objective but with different properties. Additionally, formol can’t be used as an alternative to [[isopentane]] because the former inhibits enzymatic activity. Isopentane itself is cooled in liquid nitrogen and allows for instant freezing of the sample and therefore prevents tissue damage. [[Glutaraldehyde]] is a fixator used for [[Electron Microscopy]].

After treatment and freezing of the samples, these are cut using specific machines like the cryostat. Finally, the desired technique is applied to the tissue.

## Nerves (PNS)

[[Biopsy]] from the [[sural nerve]]. It is sectioned in 2 portions – one in formol for later [[paraffin]] fixation and the other in [[glutaraldehyde]] for electron microscopy.

## Nervous Tissue (CNS)

For preserved tissue, the usual procedure is very similar to standard histological procedures. Fixation with 10% formol, processing with increasingly concentrated alcohol, passing later to [[xylol]] ([paraffin is soluble in xylol](https://www.nsh.org/blogs/michael-gubler/2019/07/16/xylene-substitutes)); then follows embedding, cutting, coloration and visualization.

**[[Extemporaneous exams]]** are easier and faster to perform, and the samples allow for the making of several smears. The procedure consists of fixation in cold [[acetone]] (-20ºC) for 5 minutes, followed by treatment with 70% [[alcohol]] and [[distilled water]]; afterwards the coloration is applied, the section is dried and mounted.

For histological studies of the whole encephalon, the procedure is to embed the encephalon in formol for 2-6 weeks.
