## Arterial irrigation

Comes from the [[Aortic arch]]. From these come the [[Carotid arteries]] and [[Vertebral arteries]] (come from [[Subclavian arteries]]).

The carotid arteries branch into the internal carotid artery (brain irrigation) and the external carotid artery (face irrigation). The internal artery gives rise to the [[Ophthalmic artery]], [[Anterior cerebral artery]] (A.C.A) and the [[Medial cerebral artery]] (M.C.A). The vertebral arteries join to form the [[Basilar artery]], and this gives rise to the [[Posterior cerebral artery]] (P.C.A). Together these form the [[Circle of Willis]].

## Venous irrigation

There are **superficial, deep, and basal veins**. These are drained in the [[dural venous sinuses]], in between the layers of the dura matter. In the brain, there are the [[superior sagittal sinus]] and [[inferior sagittal sinus]]. The sinuses then drain to the [[jugular veins]].
