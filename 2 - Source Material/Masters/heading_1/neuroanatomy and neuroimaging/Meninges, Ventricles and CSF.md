## Meninges, Ventricles and CSF

### Meninges

3 meningeal layers, which cover the SNS and PNS:

- Dura matter (endosteal and meningeal layers)
- Arachnoid (subarachnoid space)
- Pia matter

These fold in the CNS (e.g. Falx cerebri) but not the PNS.

### Ventricles

These allow the production flow of CSF and consist of:

- Lateral ventricles
- Interventricular foramina
- Third ventricle
- Cerebral aqueduct
- Fourth ventricle
- Central canal

These contain the choroid plexus, which produce CSF. The lateral ventricles produce 80-90% of all CSF.

### CSF

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is somewhat similar to that of blood plasma and interstitial fluid. It is present in the ventricular system within the CNS and in the subarachnoid space surrounding the CNS. It bathes both the external and internal surfaces of the brain and spinal cord. In an adult, the total volume of CSF is about 150 ml, out of which only 30 ml is in the ventricular system and remainder in the subarachnoid space.
