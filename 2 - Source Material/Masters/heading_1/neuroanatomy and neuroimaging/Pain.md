## Pain

### Pain Definition and Classification

Pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.” It can either be acute, which normally serves as a cue for an underlying disease, or chronic.

- Chronic primary pain: represents chronic pain as a disease in itself. Characterized by disability or emotional distress. Ex: chronic widespread pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain previously termed “non-specific”, primary headaches, painful conditions such as chronic pelvic pain and irritable bowel syndrome.
- Chronic secondary pain: chronic pain where the pain is a symptom of an underlying condition.

Pain can also be classified according to its origin:

- Nociceptive - Pain that arises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue and is due to the activation of nociceptors (a high-threshold sensory receptor of the peripheral somatosensory nervous system that is capable of transducing and encoding noxious stimuli). It is a “physiological” pain, which aims to protect the body against lesions associated to noxious stimuli.
- Neuropathic - Pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. It is a “pathological” pain; it does not have any physiological function.

### Mechanisms of Pain

**Transduction**

Transduction of noxious stimuli occurs in specialized primary afferent endings at the periphery – the nociceptors. Nociceptors terminate as free nerve endings in skin, muscle, viscera or joints.

The cell bodies of the Primary Afferent Neurons are located in Trigeminal Ganglia (TG) or Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG). Satellite Glial Cells (SGCs) form a structure capable of allowing cross-depolarization between neurons.

Types of fibres transmitting pain stimuli include the Aδ (fast and localized pain) and C fibers (slow, diffuse and maintained pain). Aβ fibers transmit innocuous stimuli.

**Transmission**

Information flows until the neurons of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where it crosses it and rises to the thalamus, by way of projection neurons.

**Perception**

There are several areas associated with pain perceptions. The most important are: Thalamic nuclei (e.g. ventral posterior), brainstem catecholaminergic cell groups, Parabrachial nucleus, the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) and the dentato-rubro-thalamic (DRt).

### Pain Modulation

Achieved by descending pathways. It is dependent of opioids and noradrenaline, which are both anti-nociceptive, and serotonin, which is anti-nociceptive when activating its depolarizing receptors.

**Peripheral Sensitization**

It occurs in an inflammatory context, due to the overexpression of inflammatory receptors and leading to the presence of allodynia. SGCs can also contribute to this sensitization.

**Central Sensitization**

Associated with the increase of glutamatergic signalling between the primary neurons and the projecting neurons.

### Neuropathic Pain

Can be caused in cases of neuronal damage, in which a retraction bulb is formed and over-expresses α2 receptors, which will lead to pain. There can also exist phenomena of ephatic crosstalk, in which neurons are activated by the lack of myelin isolation and protection.
