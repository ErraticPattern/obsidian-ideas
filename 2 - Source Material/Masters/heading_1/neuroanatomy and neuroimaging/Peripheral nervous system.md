## Peripheral nervous system

### Cranial nerves (12 pairs)

Innervate head and neck.

- Purely sensory: 1,2,8
- Purely motor: 3,4,6,11,12
- Sensory and motor: 5,9,10

Motor nuclei (third-order neuron):

- Somatic and branchial (similar to spinal cord motor nuclei)
- Visceral (Parasympathetic nervous system)

Sensory nuclei (second-order neuron):

- General
- Visceral
- Special

#### Olfactory nerve

- Medial olfactory striae

Anterior commissure -> opposite olfactory bulb

- Lateral olfactory striae

Periamygdaloid and prepiriform (primary olfactory cortex)

Entorhinal area (area 28) of the parahippocampal gyrus (secondary olfactory cortex)

#### Optic nerve

Responsible for the sense of vision. Some neurons from the optic tract go to nucleus of the oculomotor.

#### Oculomotor nerve (2 nuclei)

Main oculomotor nucleus (connected to pretectal nucleus and superior colliculi; receives information from 4 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]),6 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) and 8 ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) cranial nerve via the medial longitudinal fasciculus)

Edinger-Westphal nuclei (Parasympathetic)

#### Trochlear nerve

Remember L6SO4 and name of nerve. This nerve fibers immediately decussate.

#### Trigeminal nerve (4 nuclei)

Main sensory, spinal and mesencephalic nuclei (sensory root of trigeminal ganglion)

- Ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular branches. Information crosses in brainstem -> thalamus -> cortex

Motor nucleus (motor root of trigeminal ganglion)

- Chewing and swallowing

#### Abducens nerve

Remember L6SO4 and name of nerve.

#### Facial nerve (3 nuclei)

Main motor nucleus (present within the reticular formation) – voluntary control of face muscles (involuntary control is done by a nucleus of the reticular formation)

Superior salivatory and lacrimal nuclei (parasympathetic fibers which innervate glands). Both are afferent to hypothalamus. The first receives from sensory nucleus of VII and the second receives from the ophthalmic portion of the V.

The sensory nucleus receives taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, and the palate.

#### Vestibulocochlear nerve (2 nuclei complexes)

Vestibular nerve gives the position and motion of the head; Information comes from the vestibular labyrinth (filled with endolymph inside the 3 semi-circular canals). Endolymph flows to the ampulla where hair cells transduce the signals – these compute angular acceleration and give the position and motion of the head. The hair cells have an elastic component which allows for habituation to movement.

Utricle and saccule give gravitational forces and linear acceleration of the head. An **otolith** is a calcium carbonate structure in the saccule or utricle of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular system of vertebrates. The saccule and utricle, in turn, together make the otolith organs. These organs are what allows an organism, including humans, to perceive linear acceleration, both horizontally and vertically (gravity).

The **vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)** is a reflex acting to stabilize gaze during head movement, with eye movement due to activation of the vestibular system. The reflex acts to stabilize images on the retinas of the eye during head movement. The head impulse test is a test that assesses the VOR.

Figure 61. The Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) pathway. Turning the head to the right means that, under physiological circumstances, there will be higher vestibular system in the right-side provoking saccades to the left.

**Cochlear nerve** – responsible for hearing. Scala vestibuli and scala tympani (paralymph); Cochlear duct (endolymph). Movement of endolymph causes vibration of basilar membrane (present in the organ of Corti); it responds differently to each frequency along its length.

Figure 63. Vestibular and cochlear components.

The vestibulocochlear connects to the vestibular nuclei and cochlear nuclei.

- Some fibers with vestibular information bypass the nuclei and connect with the cerebellum (vestibulo-cerebellar tract). Fibers form the vestibulospinal tract and others connect with the medial longitudinal fasciculus. It also connects with the cortex.
- Fibers with hearing information cross after being relayed from cochlear nucleus and form the lateral lemniscus. Then, fibers either stop at the inferior colliculi or go to the medial geniculate body and to the temporal cortex.

#### Glossopharyngeal nerve (3 nuclei)

- Motor nucleus

From nucleus ambiguus which innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle (swallowing).

- Parasympathetic nucleus

From inferior salivatory – parotid glands (receives input from olfactory and taste information).

- Sensory nucleus

To the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) which has taste information from posterior 1/3 of third and finishes on the insula of the cortex. Also gets information from baroreceptors in carotid sinus.

To spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve – from tongue, soft palate, and mucous membrane of pharynx.

#### Vagus nerve (3 nuclei)

It is clear that the VII, IX and X cranial nerves are intimately related in their functions. Why should that be so? These cranial nerves form the solitary tract.

- Motor nucleus

From nucleus ambiguus – supply the constrictor muscles of the pharynx and the intrinsic muscles of the larynx.

- Parasympathetic nucleus

From and to the dorsal nucleus of the Vagus (receives input from hypothalamus and glossopharyngeal nerve with information from sinus reflex) – efferent fibers are distributed to the involuntary muscle of the bronchi, heart, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine as far as the distal third of the transverse colon. Gets information from chemoreceptors.

- Sensory nucleus

To lower part of tractus solitarius – taste.

To spinal nucleus – common sensations.

#### Accessory nerve (2 nucleus)

- From nucleus ambiguus – 1 cranial root

Joins vagus nerve and innervates larynx and pharynx.

- From spinal nucleus – 1 spinal root (leaves at spinal cord level)

Innervates sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles (2 largest muscles form neck)

#### Hypoglossal nerve (1 nucleus)

Hypoglossal nucleus – Innervates muscles of the tongue – manipulating its shape and movement.

### Spinal Cord (31 pairs)

Divided into ventral, lateral, and dorsal sides. It is found within the vertebral column divided into: 7C, 12T, 5L, 1S, 1C – 26 vertebras (in adults; babies have 33 vertebras). Each vertebra consists of a vertebral body and arch, which surround the spinal cord, present in the vertebral foramen (the C7 vertebra is the first one to be felt).

Figure 65. Vertebral column segmentation and components.

Spinal cord consists of 31 pairs of spinal nerves – 8C, 12T, 5L, 5S, 1C; it extends from C1 to L1/L2 vertebras (to L3 in newborns). The spinal cord is the same size as the vertebral column until the third month in intrauterine life; thereafter, the vertebral column starts to outgrow the spinal cord.

In the cervical region, where it gives origin to the brachial plexus, and in the lower thoracic and lumbar regions, where it gives origin to the lumbosacral plexus, the spinal cord is fusiformly enlarged (more grey matter for more innervated muscles). After L1, it tapers off into the conus medullaris – an extension of pia matter forms the filum terminale. The structure composed of the nerves, inferior to L1, is called cauda equina.

#### Pathways

Figure 66. Principal fiber tracts of the spinal cord.

The anterior and lateral spinothalamic tracts are represented but not labelled. The first carries information for crude touch and the second carries information for pain and temperature.

The dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway (DCML) (also known as the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, PCML) is the name given to the pathway that carries sensory information; it goes from the dorsal column to the medial lemniscus, and then to the thalamus, finishing in the cortex.

Figure 67. Information regarding the ascending and descending pathways of the spinal cord.

Except for thoracic nerves from T3 to T11, the anterior primary rami of all the spinal nerves join together and/or branch to form a network of nerves known as nerve plexus. There are three major plexuses:

- Cervical plexus

Neck and diaphragm (phrenic nerve).

- Brachial plexus

Muscles of upper limb (e.g., medial, ulnar, and radial nerves).

- Lumbar plexus

Muscles of thighs (e.g. obturator and femoral nerve)

- Sacral plexus

Muscles of legs (e.g. sciatic, tibial and peroneal nerve)
