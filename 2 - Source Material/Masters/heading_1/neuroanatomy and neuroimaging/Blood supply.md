## Blood supply

### CNS blood supply

#### Arterial irrigation

Comes from the aortic arch. From these come the carotid arteries and vertebral arteries (come from subclavian arteries).

The carotid arteries branch into the internal carotid artery (brain irrigation) and the external carotid artery (face irrigation). The internal artery gives rise to the ophthalmic artery, anterior cerebral artery (A.C.A) and the medial cerebral artery (M.C.A). The vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery, and this gives rise to the posterior cerebral artery (P.C.A). Together these form the circle of Willis.

#### Venous irrigation

There are superficial, deep, and basal veins. These are drained in the venous sinuses, in between the layers of the dura matter. In the brain, there are the superior sagittal and inferior sagittal sinuses. The sinuses then drain to the jugular veins.

### PNS blood supply

#### Arterial irrigation

Spinal cord is supplied by the anterior spinal artery, 2 posterior spinal arteries and segmental arteries, mainly.
