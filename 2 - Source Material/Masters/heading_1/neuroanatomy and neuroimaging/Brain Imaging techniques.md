#### Functional Ultrasound (fUS)

Better application in newborns, since the fontanelles allow for the passage of ultrasound waves more readily. It can also be applied in adults, using other methods. Its spatial resolution can reach the 5 µm mark. It can be used for observation of red blood cells in the vessels.

#### Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is an optical brain monitoring technique which uses near-infrared spectroscopy for the purpose of functional neuroimaging. Therefore, it is a type of transcranial optical imaging techniques. See more.

### Appendix on radioactivity

Becquerel found in 1896 spontaneous radiation emitted by uranium salts. Later, Pierre and Marie Currie described Polonium and Radium, in 1898, and postulate a theory of radiation.

Radioisotopes are isotopes which naturally release energy by the nucleus, either in particles or electromagnetic radiation, due to decay as a result of their instability. The stability of an isotope depends on the neutron-proton ratio and the size of the isotope, as can be observed in the image below.

One very important feature of radioisotopes is that they preserve the chemical properties when decaying occurs, albeit the physical properties change. The principal of radiotracer thus bases itself on this property and consists in the use of a radiopharmaceutical (radioisotope + biological molecule), which participates in biological processes but does not interfere with them. There are 30+ types of radioisotopes utilized in clinical settings.

Figure 22. In this figure, each dot is an isotope, and we can say that all the stable isotopes are located in a region that we call “belt of stability”. If we analyse the diagram, we see that up to Z = 20, the neutron to proton ratio is 1. However, for Z > 20, the number of neutrons seems to be higher than that of protons for a stable isotope. If a nucleus has a very high neutron to proton ratio, then it lies above the belt of stability and hence such nuclei tend to decay in order to lower the n:p ratio. In this process, a neutron may decay to a proton, electron, and an anti-electron neutrino particle (beta- decay). Now, a new isotope is produced that has a lowered n:p ratio and hence is more stable than the earlier nucleus. For instance, consider the decay of O-19. It has 8 protons and 11 neutrons. The n:p is greater than 1. It decays to F-19, which has 9 protons and 10 neutrons. So you see that n:p ratio is lower than before, so it has higher stability. Similarly, the nucleus with a very low neutron to proton ratio (the one with significantly higher number of protons than neutrons) lie below belt of stability, and they decay through beta plus decay where a positron and an electron neutrino are emitted. This results in an increased n:p ratio. E.g. the decay of F-18. It has 9 protons and 9 neutrons. Now you may ask why would F-18 decay if it has 9 protons and 9 neutrons such that the n:p ratio is 1 and that is exactly what we wanted. It turns out that the reason can be explained by nuclear shell model where nucleus tends to stabilize itself by its tendency to rearrange the number of protons and neutrons to what is popularly called as “the magic numbers”. It decays to O-18, which has 8 protons and 10 neutrons. It so turns out that 8 is a magic number. And hence, the nuclear shell is complete and thus, more stable. This exactly explains why even proton-even neutron nuclei are more stable than odd-odd or odd-even or even-odd nuclei. When nuclei are both even in numbers, they completely pair up with each other and hence, nuclear binding energy is higher. Let me be clear though, n:p ratio is thus, not the only factor that determines the stability of a nucleus. There are other factors like whether the number of protons and neutrons are odd or even, and whether the nucleus is “doubly magic” (meaning that the number of protons and neutrons are one of 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126(only for neutrons)). The concept of seeking idea about stability through n:p ratio is the prime idea of the liquid drop model, while the concept of magic numbers was the outcome of nuclear shell model.

There are several types of decay; these depend on the neutron-proton ration and are represented in the image below.

#### β-decay and γ-decay

In β-decay, a proton decays into a neutron and releases its charge in the form of a positron/β ([[#^comment-0|Comment Unknown Author 1]]) (anti-particle of the electron). The positron will then collide with an electron and release its energy in the form of 2 γ-rays of the same energy which travel in the opposite direction to each other (180º angle).

In γ-decay there is no ejected particle from the nucleus but only release of energy in the form of 1 γ-ray which is more erratic in its energy value.

#### X-rays
Röntgen discovered x-rays in 1895 by using a cathode ray tube. This device led to the discovery of some properties of these rays: that it was negatively charged, travelled in a straight line and was made of particles capable of transferring kinetic energy ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXOeehVTcRA)).

X-rays were first used in clinical practice to check the presence of intracerebral tumours. Schüller is considered the “father” of neuroradiology and wrote the Röntgen-diagnostik der Erkrankungen des Kopfes (Radiology of Diseases of the Head) in 1912. In contemporary neurology, clinical use of x-ray is very limited and useful only for cranial fractures and indirect diagnosis.
