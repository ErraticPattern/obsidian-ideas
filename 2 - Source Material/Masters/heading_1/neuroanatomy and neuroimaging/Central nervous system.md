## Central nervous system

### Cerebrum

It is composed of 2 hemispheres, divided by the longitudinal fissure. It contains a cortex (grey matter), with 6 cortical layers, in depth. The cortex can be divided into lobes.

Figure 26. Overview of cortical lobes.

#### Frontal (executive functions and motor control)

##### Precentral Gyrus

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 22.png>)

Figure 27. The motor and sensory homunculi. The precentral gyrus encodes the motor homunculus. Output from the motor cortex is organized in similar fashion. The amount of cortical surface dedicated to a part of the body is related to the degree of motor control of that part. Thus, in humans, much of the motor cortex is dedicated to controlling the muscles of the fingers and the muscles related to speech.

##### The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a prefrontal cortex region in the frontal lobes of the brain which is involved in the cognitive process of decision-making. In non-human primates it consists of the association cortex areas Brodmann area 11, 12 and 13; in humans it consists of Brodmann area 10, 11 and 47 ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitofrontal_cortex)).

Figure 28. OFC location.

##### BA 44 (pars opercularis)

Brodmann area 44 (BA 44), also known as **pars opercularis** (of the inferior frontal gyrus), is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Situated just anterior to premotor cortex (BA6) and on the lateral surface, inferior to BA9. It refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. It is associated with **syntax**.

#### Parietal (sensorial and language)

The parietal lobe can be divided into two functional regions. One region involves sensation and perception, and the other region is concerned with integrating sensory input, primarily with the visual system. Moreover, the postcentral gyrus is responsible for somatosensation. This region receives input from the somatosensory relays of the thalamus and represents information about touch and sense (Kim et al., 2010).

##### Postcentral gyrus

![Diagram  Description automatically generated](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Diagram  Description automatically generated 1.png>)

Figure 29. The area of cortex dedicated to processing sensory information (postcentral gyrus) from a particular part of the body is not proportional to the mass of the body part but instead reflects the density of sensory receptors in that part. Thus, sensory input from the lips and hands occupies more area of cortex than, say, that from the elbow.

##### Retrosplenial Cortex (RSC)

It is 100 years since Brodmann delineated the human RSC (areas 29 and 30) within the posterior cingulate region. Early studies characterized the memory impairments following RSC damage as disconnection effects resulting from the interruption of pathways from the hippocampus to either the anterior thalamic nuclei or the frontal cortex.

It does seem incontrovertible that the RSC is important for spatial navigation. Perhaps the biggest challenge lies in linking the RSC’s role in navigation with its involvement in episodic memory, imagination and thinking about the future while being precise about its specific contributions. Furthermore, the RSC is involved in contextual mapping of permanent landmarks, and orientation relative thereto.

##### Fusiform gyrus

Also known as the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus. It is part of the temporal lobe and occipital lobe in Brodmann area 37.

#### Occipital (vision)

##### Lingual Gyrus

![undefined](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/undefined 2.png>)

Figure 34. Lingual gyrus location.

The lingual gyrus is a tongue-shaped structure that lies on the medial aspect of the occipital lobe along the inferomedial (tentorial) surface. It is a brain structure that is linked to processing vision, especially related to letters. It is thought to also play a role in analysis of logical conditions (i.e., logical order of events) and encoding visual memories. It is named after its shape, which is somewhat similar to a tongue. Contrary to the name, the region has little to do with speech. It is believed that a hypermetabolism of the lingual gyrus is associated with visual snow ([[#^footnote-6|Comment Unknown Author 6]]).

##### V1 area (BA18 and BA19)

#### Fibers

There are 3 types of fibers:

- Commissural (inter-hemispherical)
- Association (intra-hemispherical)
- Projection (outer-hemispherical)

##### Corpus Callosum

### Limbic system

Emotion, drive, and memory as its main functions – It must then be responsible for the association of memories with emotion. The visceral responses following activities in limbic system are expressed through hypothalamus by way of autonomic nervous system.

#### Pericallosal ([[#^footnote-7|Comment Unknown Author 7]])

Indusium griseum (vestigial) -> Gyrus fasciolaris (around splenium of corpus callosum) -> Dentate Gyrus -> Uncus (All this constitutes the thing layer of grey matter around the corpus callosum).

**Medial and lateral longitudinal striae** (fibers) are found on either side of the midline of the **Indusium griseum**.

Figure 39. Indusium Griseum anatomy.

#### Subcallosal gyri

The subcallosal gyrus (paraterminal gyrus, peduncle of the corpus callosum) is a narrow lamina on the medial surface of the hemisphere in front of the lamina terminalis, behind the **parolfactory area**, and below the rostrum of the corpus callosum. It is continuous around the genu of the corpus callosum with the indusium griseum.

#### Cingulate gyri

The cingulate gyrus (CG) is involved in adaptive control of behavior and conflict monitoring. It is not fully developed in adolescents which might contribute to the latter’s observed poor decision-making capabilities. It is known as the satisfaction centre of the brain.

### Diencephalon

#### Hypothalamus

Controls autonomic (Preoptic and anterior areas – parasympathetic response/Lateral and posterior areas – sympathetic response), limbic and endocrine functions.

**Nuclei** (anterior to posterior/periventricular to medial to lateral (in relation to fornix)):

**Lateral side ([[#^footnote-8|Comment Unknown Author 8]]):**

The large nerve cells throughout the lateral zone are relatively sparse and collectively constitute the lateral nucleus. This nucleus occupies the whole anteroposterior extent of the hypothalamus.

I just had a lecture (18/01/2024) where the authors of experiments related to spinal cord injuries and its rehabilitation through the use of stimulation devices showed that the lateral hypothalamus is a region implicated in the motor control of gait. It is so because it connects with a specific subtype of neuron (classified genetically based on RNA) which is known to be involved in the control of the gait (mechanics of gait). These neurons are strengthened upon stimulation while other types of neurons are inhibited, thereby reducing spasms and increasing motor control in patients with spinal cord injuries.

**Medial side:**

- Anterior

Preoptic (telencephalic origin) – Parasympathetic NS control and synthesis of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) – released into portal system. Ventral lateral preoptic (VLPO) regulates sleep.

Supraoptic – synthetises vasopressin.

Paraventricular nucleus – synthetises oxytocin.

Periventricular nucleus

##### Connections

Figure 47. Connections made with hypothalamus.

#### Thalamus

Functions as the gateway of the cortex. It integrates every type of sensory information, except smell. The fiber connections have been established, and, following removal of the cortex, the thalamus can appreciate crude sensations. However, the cerebral cortex is required for the interpretation of sensations based on past experiences. Very interesting! – (see page 395 of Snell’s).

Figure 48. Thalamic connectivity with cortical regions.

##### Nuclei

- Anterior

Anterior nucleus involved with the limbic lobe and cingulate gyrus (Papez circuit).

- Medial

Dorsomedial nucleus and other smaller nuclei. The first connects heavily with the frontal lobe, responsible for behaviour and motivation, and hypothalamus. Integrates sensory information, visceral and somatic.

- Lateral (anterior – motor cortex/ posterior – sensory cortex)
- Ventral

VA, VL (these two connect with basal ganglia are motor related), VP – VPL and VPM (divided into 2 and sense related)

- Dorsal

LD (limbic system with anterior nucleus), LP and Pulvinar (last two heavily related to integration of visual information)

- Internal medullary lamina

intralaminar nuclei (connects with reticular formation through the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS))

- Interthalamic connection

midline nuclei (connect to reticular formation)

- Periphery of thalamus

**Reticular nucleus** (Thalamic reticular nucleus) is a thin layer of nerve cells sandwiched between the external medullary lamina and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. It contains cells that have spontaneous rhythmic oscillatory activity, which generate sleep spindles.

**Medial geniculate body** (auditory pathway).

**Lateral geniculate body** (visual pathway).

##### White matter

- The thalamus is covered on its superior surface by a thin layer of white matter, called the stratum zonale, and on Its lateral surface by another layer, the external medullary lamina.
- Internal medullary lamina (Y-shaped, divides thalamus and contains some nuclei).

##### Connections

#### Epithalamus

Habenula and pineal gland.

#### Subthalamus

Subthalamic nucleus (STN) and zona incerta.

### Basal Nuclei

The caudate nucleus and the putamen form the main sites for receiving input to the basal nuclei. The globus pallidus forms the major site from which the output leaves the basal nuclei. Unlike many other parts of the nervous system concerned with motor control, the basal nuclei have no direct input or output connections with the spinal cord. In what way is this relevant?

#### Corpus striatum (Lentiform nucleus ([[#^footnote-9|Comment Unknown Author 9]]) + caudate)

Divided embryologically into:

- Paleostriatum
- Neostriatum

Divided functionally into:

- Dorsal striatum

Composed of the lentiform nucleus ([[#^footnote-10|Comment Unknown Author 10]]) and caudate nucleus.

- Ventral Striatum

Composed of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 38.png>)

Figure 51. Basal ganglia connections.

Taken from Snell’s. It is important to notice how the striatum seems like a correcting structure or an overseer, i.e. computes something which is necessary for coordination of inputs so that correct information goes back to the cortex and then to the effector muscles. It might be that it integrates both sensory and motor information, so that an efficient action can follow. It is perhaps a cousin of the cerebellum; the basal nuclei help compute fine and conscious-required movements while the cerebellum computes the more automatized movements. If there is still crude movement if the motor cortex is destroyed, then it might be that the basal nuclei prepare the fine motor control by a crude movement, that is, completing each other. “In this way, the basal nuclei assist in the regulation of voluntary movement and the learning of motor skills”.

#### Amygdaloid nucleus

#### Claustrum

Thin grey matter band lateral to external capsule and whose function is not well elucidated.

#### Peripheral fibers

- Internal capsule
- External capsule
- Extreme capsule

#### Associated pathways

- Direct pathway – excitation of movement (regulated by the Substantia Nigra – can lead to PD in loss of it)
- Indirect pathway – inhibition of movement (regulated by Striatum – can result in chorea in loss of it)

### Reticular formation

The reticular formation consists of a deeply placed continuous network of nerve cells and fibers that extend from the spinal cord through the medulla, the pons, the midbrain, the subthalamus, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus.

Multiple ascending pathways carrying sensory Information to higher centers are channelled through the reticular formation, which, in tum, projects this information to different parts of the cerebral cortex, causing a sleeping person to awaken. The question is if it simply contributes to consciousness by being a pathway for the cortex or if itself creates consciousness.

Divided into columns:

- Median
- Medial
- Lateral

### Cerebellum

Located in the posterior fossa, below the tentorium cerebelli. It has 2 hemispheres and the Vermis in between. It contains the anterior lobe (spinocerebellum), posterior lobe (cerebrocerebellum) and flocullonodular lobe (vestibulocerebellum). Each lobe is divided into lobules and these into folium. It seems that the motor representation of the motor body is not inverted.

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 39.png>)

It contains internal nuclei: Dentate nucleus, Interposed nuclei (Globose and Emboliform nuclei) and the Fastigial nucleus – these are the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN).

![](<2 - Source Material/Masters/attachments/Attachment 40.png>)

Functionally it is divided into Vermis, the paravermis and lateral hemispheres.

Figure 52. The unfolded cerebellum.

#### Cortical layers

- Molecular
- Stellate cells (inhibits PCs)
- Basket cells (inhibits PCs)
- Purkinje Cell
- Purkinje cells (PCs)
- Bergmann Glia
- Granular
- Golgi cells (these inhibit the granular cells)
- Granular cells (only excitatory neuron from cerebellum)

#### Afferent connections ([[#^footnote-11|Comment Unknown Author 11]])

- Climbing fibers (Each fiber establishes multiple synapses with only one Purkinje cell, as well as with the stellate and basket cells) – these come from the olivo-cerebellar tracts (from inferior olivary nucleus); these are monosynaptic.

- Mossy fibers (Synapse with cells from the granular layers; granule cells give off parallel fibers which synapse with PCs; 1 PC to lots of different granule cells); therefore these are polysynaptic.

- Multilayered fibers (From noradrenergic and serotoninergic projections from the brainstem (locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei) and histaminergic projections from the hypothalamus – these don’t terminate in the PC layer.

#### Efferent connections

The DCN receives input exclusively from Purkinje cells (inhibitory); the DCN only gives excitatory efferent fibers.

### Brainstem

Functions of brainstem: allow for ascending and descending tracts, communicating between spinal cord, cerebrum, and cerebellum; contains nucleus of the cranial nerves (from III to XII); it contains important reflex centers associated with the control of respiration and the cardiovascular system and with the control of consciousness.

It contains: (1) Medulla oblongata; (2) Pons; (3) Mesencephalon.

#### Medulla Oblongata

It is continuous with the spinal cord (foramen magnum marks separation); it shares the anterior median fissure and posterior sulcus of the spinal cord. Posteriorly, it contains the gracile and cuneate tubercules, produced by the respective nuclei, which receive the respective fasciculi from the spinal cord.

The caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dorsal vagal nucleus, DVN), nucleus ambiguus (NA), and supramedullary sites, including the hypothalamus, are reciprocally connected to the NTS. The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) receives monosynaptic inputs from the commissural NTS. The DVN, NA, and RVLM are major efferent pathways of the parasympathetic and sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.
