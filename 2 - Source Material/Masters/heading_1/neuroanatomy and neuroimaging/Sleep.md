## Sleep

Sleep is a reversible behaviour in which there is an altered stage of consciousness characterized by diminished response to stimuli and complex physiological patterns. It is characterized in distinct phases: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep is divided into phases N1, N2 and N3.

### NREM sleep

It occupies 80% of sleeping time and it consists of the N1, N2 and N3 phases. The threshold for a person to wake up in NREM is diminished. The N3 phase is mostly associated with somnambulism.

### REM sleep

It occupies 20% of sleeping time. It reflects deep sleep but in which it is possible to awaken spontaneously. When a person is in REM sleep and is woken up, it is likely that the person will remember what it was dreaming about. It’s a phase characterized by atony.

### Hypnogram

It allows the analysis of sleep phase evolution throughout sleep. It can be analysed microstructurally or microstructurally.

### Anatomy and Physiology of the Wake-Sleep cycle

Early sleep investigation showed that at the level of the diencephalon-mesencephalic junction area, anterior lesions caused insomnia while posterior lesions caused hypersomnia. These findings were then associated with specific nuclei which regulate the wake-sleep cycle. Although the Kleine-Levin syndrome seems to be associated with hypothalamic function dysregulation, its etiology is still largely unknown.

**Wakefulness** is regulated by brainstem pathways, consisting of aminergic, cholinergic and orexinergic signals. If the orexinergic ([[#^footnote-12|Comment Unknown Author 12]]) system fails, then the patient will develop narcolepsy ([[#^footnote-13|Comment Unknown Author 13]]).

Figure 74. | A schematic drawing showing some key components of the ascending arousal system. A major input to the relay and reticular nuclei of the thalamus (yellow pathway) originates from cholinergic (ACh) cell groups in the upper pons, the pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT). These inputs facilitate thalamocortical transmission. A second pathway (red) activates the cerebral cortex to facilitate the processing of inputs from the thalamus. This arises from neurons in the monoaminergic cell groups, including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) containing histamine (His), the A10 cell group containing dopamine (DA), the dorsal and median raphe nuclei containing serotonin (5-HT), and the locus coeruleus (LC) containing noradrenaline (NA). This pathway also receives contributions from peptidergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) containing orexin (ORX) or melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and from basal forebrain (BF) neurons that contain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or ACh. Note that all of these ascending pathways traverse the region at the junction of the brainstem and forebrain where von Economo noted that lesions caused profound sleepiness (Saper et al., 2005).

**Sleep** is regulated mainly by the hypothalamic nucleus VLPO. VLPO regulates sleep by inhibiting the action of the wakefulness pathways.

A schematic drawing to show the key projections of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) to the main components of the ascending arousal system. It includes the monoaminergic cell groups (red) such as the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), the A10 cell group, the raphe cell groups and the locus coeruleus (LC). It also innervates neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA; green), including the perifornical (PeF) orexin (ORX) neurons, and interneurons in the cholinergic (ACh) cell groups (yellow), the pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT). Note that the VLPO neurons lie within the region outlined by von Economo for the anterior hypothalamic lesion that caused insomnia. 5-HT, serotonin; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; gal, galanin; NA, noradrenaline; His, histamine.

### Circadian Rhythm

Process S (or Process H) refers to the homeostatic sleep pressure that builds up over time spent awake. Process C is a sleep-independent process that reflects our internal daily rhythms kept in sync with the Earth's near 24-h cycle through the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN antagonizes homeostatic sleep pressure.

The timing of sleep is regulated by many factors, the most important being light. Other factors include melatonin, temperature, meals, and social interactions. Melatonin acts on the SCN. If no stimuli are given to the circadian rhythm, then the cycle will be advance 1 hour in time after each day due to the internal cycle being a little bit over 24 hours.

### Functions of sleep

It remains largely unknown although many theories have been proposed. The metabolite theory states sleep is necessary for the removal of the accumulated metabolites.

### Electrophysiology

Wakefulness is characterized by >50% α if eyelids are closed.

N1 is characterized by >50% θ signals.

Sleep spindles are bursts of neural oscillatory activity that are generated by interplay of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and other thalamic nuclei during N2-stage sleep in a frequency range of ~11 to 16 Hz (usually 12–14 Hz) with a duration of 0.5 seconds or greater (usually 0.5–1.5 seconds).

A K-complex is a waveform that may be seen on an electroencephalogram (EEG). It occurs during N2 sleep. It is the "largest event in healthy human EEG". They are more frequent in the first sleep cycles.
