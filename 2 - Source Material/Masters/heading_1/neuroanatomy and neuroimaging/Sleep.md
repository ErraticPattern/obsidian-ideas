# Sleep

Sleep is a reversible behavior in which there is an altered stage of consciousness characterized by diminished response to stimuli and complex physiological patterns. It is characterized in distinct phases: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep is divided into phases N1, N2 and N3.
