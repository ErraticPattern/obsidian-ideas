[Figure 22. In this figure, each dot is an isotope, and we can say that all the stable isotopes are located in a region that we call “belt of stability”. If we analyse the diagram, we see that up to Z = 20, the neutron to proton ratio is 1. However, for Z > 20, the number of neutrons seems to be higher than that of protons for a stable isotope. If a nucleus has a very high neutron to proton ratio, then it lies above the belt of stability and hence such nuclei tend to decay in order to lower the n:p ratio. In this process, a neutron may decay to a proton, electron, and an anti-electron neutrino particle (beta- decay). Now, a new isotope is produced that has a lowered n:p ratio and hence is more stable than the earlier nucleus. For instance, consider the decay of O-19. It has 8 protons and 11 neutrons. The n:p is greater than 1. It decays to F-19, which has 9 protons and 10 neutrons. So you see that n:p ratio is lower than before, so it has higher stability. Similarly, the nucleus with a very low neutron to proton ratio (the one with significantly higher number of protons than neutrons) lie below belt of stability, and they decay through beta plus decay where a positron and an electron neutrino are emitted. This results in an increased n:p ratio. E.g. the decay of F-18. It has 9 protons and 9 neutrons. Now you may ask why would F-18 decay if it has 9 protons and 9 neutrons such that the n:p ratio is 1 and that is exactly what we wanted. It turns out that the reason can be explained by nuclear shell model where nucleus tends to stabilize itself by its tendency to rearrange the number of protons and neutrons to what is popularly called as “the magic numbers”. It decays to O-18, which has 8 protons and 10 neutrons. It so turns out that 8 is a magic number. And hence, the nuclear shell is complete and thus, more stable. This exactly explains why even proton-even neutron nuclei are more stable than odd-odd or odd-even or even-odd nuclei. When nuclei are both even in numbers, they completely pair up with each other and hence, nuclear binding energy is higher. Let me be clear though, n:p ratio is thus, not the only factor that determines the stability of a nucleus. There are other factors like whether the number of protons and neutrons are odd or even, and whether the nucleus is “doubly magic” (meaning that the number of protons and neutrons are one of 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126(only for neutrons)). The concept of seeking idea about stability through n:p ratio is the prime idea of the liquid drop model, while the concept of magic numbers was the outcome of nuclear shell model.

[Figure 71. | A schematic drawing showing some key components of the ascending arousal system. A major input to the relay and reticular nuclei of the thalamus (yellow pathway) originates from cholinergic (ACh) cell groups in the upper pons, the pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT). These inputs facilitate thalamocortical transmission. A second pathway (red) activates the cerebral cortex to facilitate the processing of inputs from the thalamus. This arises from neurons in the monoaminergic cell groups, including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) containing histamine (His), the A10 cell group containing dopamine (DA), the dorsal and median raphe nuclei containing serotonin (5-HT), and the locus coeruleus (LC) containing noradrenaline (NA). This pathway also receives contributions from peptidergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) containing orexin (ORX) or melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and from basal forebrain (BF) neurons that contain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or ACh. Note that all of these ascending pathways traverse the region at the junction of the brainstem and forebrain where von Economo noted that lesions caused profound sleepiness (Saper et al., 2005). 109](#_Toc157731180)

[Figure 111. Illustration of direction of current flows in a magnetic coil and the induced current in the brain (from Hallett, 2007 – with permission). In magnetic stimulation, a brief, high-current pulse is produced in a coil of wire, called the magnetic coil. A magnetic field is produced with lines of flux perpendicular to the plane of the coil, which ordinarily is placed tangential to the scalp. The magnetic field can be up to about 2 T and typically lasts for about 100 ls. An electric field is induced perpendicularly to the magnetic field. The voltage of the field itself may excite neurons, but the induced currents are likely to be more important. In a homogeneous medium, spatial change of the electric field will cause current to flow in loops parallel to the plane of the coil, which will be predominantly tangential in the brain. The loops with the strongest current will be near the circumference of the coil itself. The current loops become weak near the center of the coil, and there is no current at the center itself. Neural elements are activated by the induced electric field by two mechanisms. If the field is parallel to the neural element, then the field will be most effective where the intensity changes as a function of distance. If the field is not completely parallel, activation will occur at bends in the neural element (Rossini et al., 2015). 156](#_Toc157731220)

(A) Standard NIBS approaches treat the brain as a static “black box” (left), disregarding its variable internal state and may hence result in highly variable stimulation effects. In contrast, treating the brain as the dynamic system it actually is (right) may reveal very different (state-dependent) effects, but each of them being more homogenous. (B) Open-loop brain state-independent brain stimulation neglects the current brain state; no neuroimaging method and no real-time system is necessary to control the stimulation. Open-loop brain state-dependent brain stimulation (BSDBS) uses concurrent neuroimaging (e.g., EEG) and real-time signal analysis to monitor the current brain state and to adjust and trigger brain stimulation accordingly, however, without systematically changing the monitored target brain state (e.g., TMS triggered by the amplitude or phase of a certain EEG oscillation to assess state-specific corticospinal excitability but without considerable effect on the monitored oscillation). Closed loop BSDBS additionally requires that the monitored brain state is actually changed by the stimulation, allowing to control the expression of a certain brain state (Bergmann, 2018). 159](#_Toc157731223)

[Figure 121. a | Common electrode configurations for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Dark grey regions illustrate electrode contacts, which can be activated to deliver current. Electrode designs vary with regard to the spacing between contacts as well as the number and shape of contacts. Greater contact spacing expands the range of neural targets, whereas smaller contact spacing facilitates more precise stimulation control. b | Modes of stimulation, depending on the type of DBS system in use. Unipolar stimulation refers to current being directed from the battery to the contact or vice versa. Bipolar stimulation indicates current flowing between electrode contacts, with at least one functioning as an anode and one as a cathode. Interleaving stimulation refers to the alternation of different stimulation settings. Multiple level stimulation enables multiple neural targets to be stimulated, provided that they lie along the electrode trajectory. With directional stimulation, current can be directed or ‘shaped’ on the basis of local anatomy or clinical symptoms (Krauss et al., 2021). 164](#_Toc157731230)

[Figure 122. Monopolar/Bipolar electrode configuration. A monopolar configuration will only have one electrode with current dissipating in the vicinity of that electrode with no current flowing into another electrode. Electric current density is more diffuse and radially symmetric in monopolar configurations. In bipolar configurations, a closed-loop circuit has current flowing from the working electrode to the counterelectrode, thereby allowing a narrower volume of tissue affected. Current steering uses electrodes with multiple directional surfaces to control deliver of current more specifically (Aum & Tierney, 2018). 165](#_Toc157731231)
