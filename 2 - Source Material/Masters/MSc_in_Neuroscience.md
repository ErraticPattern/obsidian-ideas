2. In his system the fundamental principle of life was pneuma (akin to the chi of Chinese medicine and the vayu of Indian medicine.) [↑](#footnote-ref-2)
    
3. If phosphenes are not caused by a ‘‘fire in the eye,’’ what are they caused by? Otto Grusser and his colleagues (1989) in Berlin studied the effect of eyeball deformation in the cat on the activity of retinal ganglion cells. They found that deformation caused a marked increase in the activity of retinal ganglion on-cells and a marked decrease in the activity of off-cells. Such a pattern of activity is certainly consistent with a phosphene-like perceptual effect. Grusser and colleagues suggested that the deformation caused retinal stretch, which in turn caused an increase in the surface of horizontal cells, which, he suggests, should depolarize them. Horizontal cell depolarization should indeed cause an increase in excitation of the on-ganglion cells and an increase in the inhibition of o¤-ganglion cells, the result they observed.

4. Papanicolaou stain is a better alternative to H&E. [↑](#footnote-ref-4)
    
5. There are several differences in the staining procedure between Kluver-Barrera and Bodian-Luxol. [↑](#footnote-ref-5)
    
6. Closed-eye hallucinations and closed-eye visualizations (CEV) are hallucinations that occur when one's eyes are closed or when one is in a darkened room. They should not be confused with phosphenes, perceived light and shapes when pressure is applied to the eye's retina, or some other non-visual external cause stimulates the eye. Some people report CEV under the influence of psychedelics; these are reportedly of a different nature than the "open-eye" hallucinations of the same compounds. Similar hallucinations that occur due to loss of vision are called "visual release hallucinations". [↑](#footnote-ref-6)
    
7. I don´t think this name exists. Not a used partition. [↑](#footnote-ref-7)
    
8. Will be considered also in the medial plane of the anterior-posterior axis of the hypothalamus. [↑](#footnote-ref-8)
    
9. The lentiform being composed of the putamen and globus pallidus. [↑](#footnote-ref-9)
    
10. It is possible that lentiform nucleus be replaced by putamen only, the globus pallidus being omitted but implicit. [↑](#footnote-ref-10)
    
11. All are excitatory. [↑](#footnote-ref-11)
    
12. Orexin is also known as hypocretin. [↑](#footnote-ref-12)
    
13. A sleep disorder that makes people very drowsy during the day. [↑](#footnote-ref-13)
    
14. Occurs when an amplifier is driven to its maximum output. [↑](#footnote-ref-14)
    
15. The signals that are present in both inputs (common to both). [↑](#footnote-ref-15)
    
16. Always starting from the right and going to the left. [↑](#footnote-ref-16)
    
17. See page 33 of Analyzing Neural Time Series Data for references. [↑](#footnote-ref-17)
    
18. These are fast brain waves but not the fastest. Additionally, the upper limit of the range can change – to around 90 or 100 Hz – depending on the definition. [↑](#footnote-ref-18)
    
19. Should try to find a reference for these claims. [↑](#footnote-ref-19)
    
20. There are techniques which can overcome these weaknesses. [↑](#footnote-ref-20)
    
21. A very interesting claim. Need a reference for it. [↑](#footnote-ref-21)
    
22. These arguments are valid for the MEG signal as well, except those related to skull and scalp properties,
    
    because the magnetic signal passes through the skull and scalp unimpeded. [↑](#footnote-ref-22)
    
23. References are cited throughout the book for further reading (page 13). [↑](#footnote-ref-23)
    
24. Referencing is not a problem in MEG. [↑](#footnote-ref-24)
    
25. See pages 56 and 57 of ANTS. [↑](#footnote-ref-25)
    
26. Lower frequencies generally suffer from more loss of temporal precision. [↑](#footnote-ref-26)
    
27. The neuroscience’s version of the uncertainty principle. [↑](#footnote-ref-27)

29. Should take this into account. [↑](#footnote-ref-29)
    
30. The amplitude is negative in positive signals and vice-versa. [↑](#footnote-ref-30)
    
31. Neurons that curve suffer different levels of current stimulation creating a stronger dipole in it and therefore being more affected. [↑](#footnote-ref-31)
    
32. A lower temperature results in slower opening and closing of the sodium channels. [↑](#footnote-ref-32)
    
33. See how many motor units each muscle has. [↑](#footnote-ref-33)
    
34. Sensory fibers have a much smaller signal and therefore more prone to noise. [↑](#footnote-ref-34)
    
35. Anodal refers, in this context, to the positively charged stimulus and cathodal refers to the negatively charged one. [↑](#footnote-ref-35)
    
36. More precise when compared to monopolar. [↑](#footnote-ref-36)

40. Interestingly, Oliver Sacks was also a bodybuilder. [↑](#footnote-ref-40)
    
41. Tumors can be classified according to grade which describes how normal or abnormal cancer cells look under a microscope. An anaplastic tumour is comprised of cells that have lost their normal, differentiated structure and function and have become highly abnormal or undifferentiated. [↑](#footnote-ref-41)
    
42. Regenerating fibres are basophile. [↑](#footnote-ref-42)

48. Remember that motor coordination in speech is analogous to knowing where something is (the moot component of knowledge). In the same way, understanding speech is analogous to knowing what something is. [↑](#footnote-ref-48)
