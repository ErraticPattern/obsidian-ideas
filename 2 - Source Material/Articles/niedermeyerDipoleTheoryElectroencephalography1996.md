> The heaviness of ions carrying electrical currents in biological tissues (sodium, potassium, chloride, etc.) is much greater than that of the free electrons of metals. Thus, the electrical resistivity of biological tissues is 10 to 100 million times greater than that of metaIs.




**Comment**: Why is the heaviness important.

### Abstract

Dipole theory has become a centerpiece of modern discussions regarding the nature of EEG phenomena. Along with dipole theory, the role of volume conduction and, in particular, the inverse problem have gained a powerful position in the modern approach to EEG. An attempt is being made to explore the origins of these concepts. Their advent and rise to a dominant position has been the expression of a new wave of biophysical approaches to EEG. These new trends started in the 1970's and have gradually overshadowed the classical neurophysiological-neurobiological approach. Electrogenesis in cerebral structures and propagation of EEG signals along pathways characterize the "old" EEG theory. It is being pointed out that dipole theory is indeed theory; it is based on spherical models of homogeneous fluid. Attempted adjustments to the brain and its anatomy have been made. Microdipoles at the neuronal level (an essential part of electrogenesis) are plausible; major problems exist as far as macrodipoles are concerned. Differences between the dipole theory in EEG and MEG are discussed. The modern search for the source of a given EEG potential (inverse problem) depends on dipole theory and may be quite misleading. Spread by volume conduction is likely to be vastly exaggerated. A plea is made for mutual understanding and tolerance.
