> It can be deduced from the foregoing discussion that for the solution of the ill-posed EEG inverse problem, the following points are noteworthy:  1. The designed algorithm should avoid the problem of not localizing the deep sources, unlike the minimum norm solution.  2. The algorithm should be developed with the ability of localizing the sources with better spatial resolution, unlike the problem posed by LORETA (and its derived methods, such as sLORETA and eLORETA), because the recovery of multiple sources is difficult with low resolution. Further, due to ill-posedness of the EEG inverse problem, one has to employ regularization methods, which cause an increase in the blurring of images in the LORETA family. So the method should be developed with higher and improved spatial resolution.  3. Repeated iterations, which is an issue with some hybrid algorithms (LORETA-FOCUSS, sLORETA-FOCUSS, etc.) cause the system to become slow as the continuous iterations in the weight matrix are time consuming. This increases the system complexity and sometimes results in the loss of information and induction of noise. So the computations should be minimized to reduce the time taken and calculations.  4. The algorithm should be validated with real-time data to confirm the results produced; the results obtained with simulated data are not good enough.

> The result for sLORETA with finite difference head modeling is shown in Figure 4.10. This shows activation in the occipital lobe with the maximum intensity level (~280 nA). Therefore, FDM-sLORETA exhibits the maximum intensity value for activation in the occipital lobe with the same time interval. It can be concluded that sLORETA with FDM head modeling can produce promising results.




**Comment**: I can use this claim as an argument for sLORETA

> use of the relation between asymmetric frontal cortical activity and the valence state [24]. Studies show that in positive-valence states, the left hemisphere of the brain cortex presents higher activity compared to the right hemisphere, whereas in negative-valence states, the right hemisphere presents higher activity than the left one [25,26]. Moreover, according to recent publications, this asymmetric activation is stronger or specific to the frontal cortex [27].

> In order to measure the activation of each hemisphere or region, some studies exploit the reported evidence that brain activity is inversely related to the preeminence of the alpha (8–12 Hz) frequency band of an EEG signal. In low brain activity periods, the alpha band increases its power relative to other bands, and vice versa [28].

> alpha asymmetry: alpha power on the right hemisphere minus alpha power on the left hemisphere. Positive values of this value will respond to greater activity of the left hemisphere relative to the right hemisphere and, therefore, correspond to positive valence states. On the contrary, negative values of alpha asymmetry will correspond to negative valence states.

> Some publications related high mental workloads with high arousal states [29], and low mental states and boredom with low arousal [30]. Other publications related eventrelated reactions in different bands and locations of the brain to arousal. Variances of event-related synchronization and desynchronization in alpha (8–12 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) bands in different areas of the brain to different arousal states induced by pictures have been reported [31]. Gamma bands (30–65 Hz) have also been reported to present higher activation for high arousal states [32].

> Conventional EEG techniques are based on visual inspection of patterns from EEG records. This involves observation of changes in wave shapes, frequencies, and transitions of states that may not be found in healthy subjects. During the last few years, more robust techniques based on signal digitization and processing have been proposed, including quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG).

> Numerous qEEG studies have found increased alpha and/or theta power in a high percentage of depressed patients [15–22]. Antidepressants reduce alpha activity [18,23–26], suggesting normalization of these deviant qEEG features (in contrast to the increased alpha caused by neuroleptics) [27–29]. Interhemispheric asymmetry, especially in anterior regions, has been reported repeatedly [30–34], as having decreased coherence [16,35,36].

> Both EEG and qEEG studies report that a high proportion of patients with mood disorders display abnormal brain electrical activity. EEG studies report that small sharp spikes and paroxysmal events are often found, especially on the right hemisphere, and that studies on abnormal sleep are common. There is broad consensus in qEEG studies that increase in alpha or theta power, as well as asymmetry and hypocoherence in anterior regions, appear most often in unipolar depressed patients.
