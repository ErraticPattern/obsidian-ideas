### Abstract

Leisure time physical activity can be a robust preventer of physical and mental illness. The health benefits of exercise have been well-documented, including decreased risk for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, and increased mood, life-satisfaction and cognitive performance (An, Xiang, Yang, & Yan, 2016; Blair & Morris, 2009). Time spent outdoors is also emerging as a predictor of positive mental health, though the outcomes are often conflated with heightened levels of physical activity. This study sought to confirm the cognitive benefits of exercise in outdoor environments using established cognitive tests while measuring brainwave activity throughout the process using portable electroencephalograph (EEG) headsets. Participants completed cognitive performance tests before and after walking indoors, then again on a different session while walking outdoors. Repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed significant cognitive improvement after both walking sessions, with elevated mental restoration observed for the outdoor walking session, as measured by a Stroop Test. EEG measures revealed a significantly higher level of meditative state during the outdoor walking session, as compared to indoors. In addition, the gains in relaxed and meditative mental states were retained longer after walking outdoors. Results are discussed within the context of growing support for leisure time exposure to natural environments and outdoor prescriptions. Implications for planning, health policy, and public education are proffered in light of these findings.
