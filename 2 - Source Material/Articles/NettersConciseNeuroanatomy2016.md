**Comment**: When looking at diagrams of neural pathways it is always interesting to try to find if there is an obvious direction it leads to. Is it like roads that connect urban hubs whose purpose is connection for the sake of interconnectedness? It seems like it. Connections are built for these hubs apparently. Is there a theory for this? Hubs must do something very important computationally. Important to note that if hubs (putative generators of consciousness) work solely for better overall survivability, then motor action is the fundamental principle of living organisms. If hubs have value in-themselves then the action they generate is of conscious nature, which seems to be the case. I feel I am conscious. There certainly is an interaction between both, i.e. conscious experience drives action. But why is this necessary? Just make everything mechanical. If it is not like this then it must have some value. Well, for me the value is in the fact that conscious processing is an hallucination by the brain that managed to interpret reality as best as it could using its limited senses. As such. the brain is now capable of iterating over simulations of reality in order to learn and better survive its environment. The early brain is a machine expecting crude input from the world based on earlier life gathered from the world, but it then optimizes itself on the actual input it gets. Make a machine with this principle and you can approximate a brain. In this, there is practical value.
