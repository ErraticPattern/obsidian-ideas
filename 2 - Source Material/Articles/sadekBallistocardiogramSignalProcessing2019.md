> Ballistocardiography (BCG) is a noninvasive technique for creating a graphical representation of the heartbeatinduced repeated motions of the human body. These repeated motions happen due to the rapid acceleration of blood when it is ejected and moved in the great vessels of the body during periods of relaxation and contraction, known as diastole and systole, respectively.

### Abstract

Across the world, healthcare costs are projected to continue to increase, and the pressure on the healthcare system is only going to grow in intensity as the rate  of growth of elderly population increases in the coming decades. As an example,  when people age one possible condition that they may experience is  sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). SDB, better known as the obstructive sleep  apnea (OSA) syndrome, and associated cardiovascular complications are among the  most common clinical disorders. The gold-standard approach to accurately diagnose  OSA, is polysomnography (PSG), a test that should be performed in a specialist  sleep clinic and requires a complete overnight stay at the clinic. The PSG system  can provide accurate and real-time data; however, it introduces several  challenges such as complexity, invasiveness, excessive cost, and absence of  privacy. Technological advancements in hardware and software enable noninvasive  and unobtrusive sensing of vital signs. An alternative approach which may help  diagnose OSA and other cardiovascular diseases is the ballistocardiography. The  ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal captures the ballistic forces of the heart caused  by the sudden ejection of blood into the great vessels with each heartbeat,  breathing, and body movement. In recent years, BCG sensors such as polyvinylidene  fluoride film-based sensors, electromechanical films, strain Gauges, hydraulic  sensors, microbend fiber-optic sensors as well as fiber Bragg grating sensors  have been integrated within ambient locations such as mattresses, pillows,  chairs, beds, or even weighing scales, to capture BCG signals, and thereby  measure vital signs. Analysis of the BCG signal is a challenging process, despite  being a more convenient and comfortable method of vital signs monitoring. In  practice, BCG sensors are placed under bed mattresses for sleep tracking, and  hence several factors, e.g., mattress thickness, body movements, motion  artifacts, bed-partners, etc. can deteriorate the signal. In this paper, we  introduce the sensors that are being used for obtaining BCG signals. We also  present an in-depth review of the signal processing methods as applied to the  various sensors, to analyze the BCG signal and extract physiological parameters  such heart rate and breathing rate, as well as determining sleep stages. Besides,  we recommend which methods are more suitable for processing BCG signals due to  their nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics.
