### Abstract

Evaluated the psychometric properties of the DASS (S. H. Lovibond and P. F. Lovibond, 1993) in 717 normal undergraduates who were also administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The DASS showed satisfactory psychometric properties and the factor structure was substantiated both by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Factor analyses suggested that the BDI differs from the DASS Depression scale primarily in that the BDI includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation, and irritability, which were not strongly or uniquely related to depression. The factor structure of the combined BDI and BAI items was virtually identical to that reported by A. T. Beck et al (see record 1989-10559-001) for a sample of diagnosed depressed and anxious patients, supporting the view that these clinical states are more severe expressions of the same states that may be discerned in normal Ss.
