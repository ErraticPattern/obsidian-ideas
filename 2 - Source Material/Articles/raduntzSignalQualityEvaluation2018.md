> To evaluate the signal quality in the frequency domain, we formulated three more hypotheses. We expected that if a device had good signal quality, we would be able to measure significant differences in the signal’s frequency band power values for the various tasks.

> Our third hypothesis was based on the so-called Berger effect (Berger, 1929). This states that the parietal alpha band power is supposed to be smaller with the eyes open than closed. This is also known as the “alpha block.”

> For each device, we considered the two rest measurements with the eyes open and closed. We removed all of the segments previously marked as artifacts. We subsequently applied a Hamming band-pass filter for the alpha frequency band (812 Hz) to the artifact-free signals of the parietal electrodes (Figure 2). The relative band power values were averaged over the electrodes for the rest measurements with the eyes open and closed.

> The fourth hypothesis was based on the dependency of the frontal theta band power on the experienced workload. Based on the results from numerous previous investigations (e.g., Gevins et al., 1998; Radüntz, 2016), we expected a significant increase in the frontal theta power when comparing the easy and more demanding cognitive tasks.

### Abstract

<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) registration as a direct measure of brain activity has unique potentials. It is one of the most reliable and predicative indicators when studying human cognition, evaluating a subject's health condition, or monitoring their mental state. Unfortunately, standard signal acquisition procedures limit the usability of EEG devices and narrow their application outside the lab. Emerging sensor technology allows gel-free EEG registration and wireless signal transmission. Thus, it enables quick and easy application of EEG devices by users themselves. Although a main requirement for the interpretation of an EEG is good signal quality, there is a lack of research on this topic in relation to new devices. In our work, we compared the signal quality of six very different EEG devices. On six consecutive days, 24 subjects wore each device for 60 min and completed tasks and games on the computer. The registered signals were evaluated in the time and frequency domains. In the time domain, we examined the percentage of artifact-contaminated EEG segments and the signal-to-noise ratios. In the frequency domain, we focused on the band power variation in relation to task demands. The results indicated that the signal quality of a mobile, gel-based EEG system could not be surpassed by that of a gel-free system. However, some of the mobile dry-electrode devices offered signals that were almost comparable and were very promising. This study provided a differentiated view of the signal quality of emerging mobile and gel-free EEG recording technology and allowed an assessment of the functionality of the new devices. Hence, it provided a crucial prerequisite for their general application, while simultaneously supporting their further development.</p>
