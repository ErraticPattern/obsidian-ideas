### Abstract

Brain source localization has been consistently implemented over the recent years to elucidate complex brain operations, pairing the high temporal resolution of the EEG with the high spatial estimation of the estimated sources. This review paper aims to present the basic principles of Electrical source imaging (ESI) in the context of the recent progress for solving the forward and the inverse problems, and highlight the advantages and limitations of the different approaches. As such, a synthesis of the current state-of-the-art methodological aspects is provided, offering a complete overview of the present advances with regard to the ESI solutions. Moreover, the new dimensions for the analysis of the brain processes are indicated in terms of clinical and cognitive ESI applications, while the prevailing challenges and limitations are thoroughly discussed, providing insights for future approaches that could help to alleviate methodological and technical shortcomings.
