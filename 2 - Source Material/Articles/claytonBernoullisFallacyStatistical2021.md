> the “statistics wars” (at least on the frequentist versus Bayesian front) are best described as a dispute about the nature and origins of probability: whether it comes from “outside us” in the form of uncontrollable random noise in observations, or “inside us” as our uncertainty given limited information on the state of the world.

> In the standard statistical framework, this creates a problem of low power, meaning a high chance of failing to find an effect even though it’s present. It also, perversely, means that an effect—if it is found—is likely overstated and unlikely to be replicable, a paradox known as the “winner’s curse.” A different but related dynamic is at work when statistical models with many parameters are “overfit” to the available data.

> the emerging best practice recommendations are to facilitate collaboration by sharing resources and materials, incentivize replication studies and meta-analyses, reserve some amount of data for “validation” or “outof-sample testing” of any model being fit, and perform power analyses to determine how large a sample is needed to find a meaningfully sized effect with high probability.

> Inferential probabilities require something more subtle; the probability of a statement depends on how much confidence we have in it. Sampling probabilities go from hypothesis to data: Given an assumption, what will we observe, and how often? Inferential probabilities go from data to hypothesis: Given what we observed, what can we conclude, and with what certainty? Sampling probabilities are fundamentally predictive; inferential probabilities are fundamentally explanatory.

> The Greeks had Tyche (called Fortuna by the Romans), the god of luck, whose responsibilities included safeguarding the city. The I Ching describes a method of fortunetelling in which the user gathers stalks of the yarrow plant, converts these to a number, and consults a corresponding prophetic hexagram. Ancient Egyptians played a dice game called Hounds and Jackals, and the Indus Valley civilization had a similar game, Gyan Chauper, which survives today in slightly modified form as Chutes and Ladders. The Romans had their aleae, rudimentary tetrahedral dice made from the ankle bones of sheep, as memorialized in Julius Caesar’s declaration upon crossing the Rubicon: “Alea iacta est.” (The die is cast.) The Jewish holiday Purim (from the Akkadian pur meaning “fate”) celebrates the story of the book of Esther, in which the Jewish people were saved from genocide on a date that had been chosen randomly. The biblical book of Leviticus refers to the high priest casting lots (in Hebrew, goralot) to decide the fate of a sacrificial goat or make other priestly decisions, and the Gospels also describe Roman soldiers casting lots (in Greek, kleron meaning “portion”) to see who would get Christ’s cloak after the Crucifixion.

> The implicit understanding present in the classical definition of probability was that the enumeration of outcomes must be done in such a way that they are equiprobable, or equally likely to occur. These are the tiny atoms from which all probabilities are then built. But, of course, this couldn’t be an explicit requirement because then the definition would be circular: probability depends on probability. Most current authors attempt to dodge this by saying the outcomes must be equally “likely,” but what is likelihood if not probability?

> Unfortunately, in a purely mathematical sense this doesn’t quite work because we can just define the selection rule to be “select an element of the sequence if and only if the outcome is heads.” Even though it seems like cheating, that’s an allowable function according to the set-theoretic axioms of math, so no random sequence meeting such a broad criterion could ever exist.

> Your friend rolls a six-sided die and secretly records the outcome; this number becomes the target T. You then put on a blindfold and roll the same six-sided die over and over. You’re unable to see how it lands so, each time, your friend (under the watchful eye of a judge, to prevent any cheating) tells you only whether the number you just rolled was greater than, equal to, or less than T. After some number of rolls, say 10, you must guess what the target was. What would be your strategy for guessing, and how confident would you be?

> 1. Enumerate all the possible hypotheses, H1, ... , Hn and  consider their probabilities not including any observation, P[H1], ... , P[Hn]. These are the prior probabilities, or  priors for short.  2. For a given observation of data, D, compute the probability of that observation assuming each hypothesis is true, in turn. These are the sampling probabilities for the data given the hypotheses.  3. Compute the probability of arriving at the observation D by means of any one of the hypotheses by multiplying the prior by the sampling probability: for example, P[H1] · P[D | H1]  and so on. We’ll call these the pathway probabilities. Summing them gives the total probability of the data: 4. Once this calculation is accomplished, the inferential probability for each hypothesis is easy to find, since it is just the relative proportion of that term in the preceding sum. These are the posterior probabilities, which, according to Bayes’ theorem, are given by

> Laplace had attempted to pin down probability assignments as the ratio of cases when there was no reason to prefer one case over another, which came to be known as the principle of insufficient reason. Keynes rebranded it as the principle of indifference and emphasized that it applies only when we have no information suggesting unequal probabilities.

> In 1900, the German mathematician David Hilbert gave an address to the International Congress of Mathematicians about what he considered to be the most important outstanding problems at the time. Known ever since then as the Hilbert problems, the 23 challenges he issued (10 during the presentation and the rest in print) set the course of mathematics for the 20th century. They attracted the attention of the greatest mathematicians of the century, and those who contributed significantly to solving any of the problems reached an even higher echelon of greatness, becoming what mathematician Hermann Weyl called “the honors class.”

> A measure in its most abstract form is a way of associating nonnegative numbers to subsets of a given master set in a way that satisfies certain constraints, such as the measure of the union of disjoint sets being the sum of the measures of each set. In Kolmogorov’s translation, the master set, or sample space, would represent all the possible outcomes of some random situation or process, like the 216 possible outcomes of rolling three dice, and the subsets would be the possible events, like the dice summing to 9 or 10. The measure of a set would be the probability of that event occurring, standardized so that the measure of the whole space was 1.

> Jaynes’s notion of probability as logic made the importance of these assumptions explicit while simultaneously showing his theory could reproduce all the frequentist results if loaded up with background assumptions consistent with the real physical behavior of the apparatus of the random experiment. In this way, he achieved a synthesis of subjective and objective probability.




**Comment**: I guess this is the reason we can say the Bayesian view is better. It is more general than the frequentist view and gives it a plausible interpretation while the latter simply rejects the bayesian view by falsely embracing objectivity.

As he put it, “If the host is required to open a door all the time and offer you a switch, then you should take the switch. But if he has the choice whether to allow a switch or not, beware.

### Abstract

There is a logical flaw in the statistical methods used across experimental science. This fault is not a minor academic quibble: it underlies a reproducibility crisis now threatening entire
disciplines. In an increasingly statistics-reliant society, this
same deeply rooted error shapes decisions in medicine, law, and
public policy with profound consequences. The foundation of the
problem is a misunderstanding of probability and its role in making inferences from observations. Aubrey Clayton traces the history of how statistics went astray, beginning with the groundbreaking work of the seventeenth-century mathematician Jacob Bernoulli and
winding through gambling, astronomy, and genetics. Clayton recounts the feuds among rival schools of statistics, exploring the
surprisingly human problems that gave rise to the discipline and
the all-too-human shortcomings that derailed it. He highlights how influential nineteenth- and twentieth-century figures developed a statistical methodology they claimed was purely objective in order to silence critics of their political agendas, including eugenics. Clayton provides a clear account of the mathematics and logic of
probability, conveying complex concepts accessibly for readers
interested in the statistical methods that frame our understanding of the world. He contends that we need to take a Bayesian
approach-that is, to incorporate prior knowledge when reasoning
with incomplete information-in order to resolve the crisis. Ranging across math, philosophy, and culture,  <i>Bernoulli's Fallacy</i>  explains why something has gone wrong with how we use data-and how to fix it.
