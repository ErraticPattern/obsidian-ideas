> Using template head models also increases both false positives and false negatives in source reconstructions. Also the effect of using more accurate FEM models compared to simple BEM models was investigated. As found in previous studies, more anatomically accurate head models result in better localization performance.

### Abstract

Introduction
              Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) are valuable for studying brain activity with millisecond-level temporal resolution. While the temporal resolution of this technique is excellent, the spatial resolution is limited. Source localization aims to identify the brain regions generating the EEG data, thus increasing the spatial resolution, but its accuracy depends heavily on the head model used. This study compares the performance of subject-specific and template-based head models in both simulated and real-world ERP localization tasks.
            
            
              Methods
              Simulated data mimicking realistic ERPs was created to evaluate the impact of head model choice systematically, after which subject-specific and template-based head models were used for the reconstruction of the data. The different modeling approaches were also applied to a face recognition dataset.
            
            
              Results
              The results indicate that the template models capture the simulated activity less accurately, producing more spurious sources and identifying less true sources correctly. Furthermore, the results show that while creating more accurate and detailed head models is beneficial for the localization accuracy when using subject-specific head models, this is less the case for template head models. The main N170 source of the face recognition dataset was correctly localized to the fusiform gyrus, a known face processing area, using the subject-specific models. Apart from the fusiform gyrus, the template models also reconstructed several other sources, illustrating the localization inaccuracies.
            
            
              Discussion
              While template models allow researchers to investigate the neural generators of ERP components when no subject-specific MRIs are available, it could lead to misinterpretations. Therefore, it is important to consider a priori knowledge and hypotheses when interpreting results obtained with template head models, acknowledging potential localization errors.
