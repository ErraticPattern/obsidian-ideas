> It seems plausible that ICA should not be used with less than 20 channels and researchers need to carefully consider the context and characteristics of their data when applying ICA and interpret the results accordingly since low electrode densities might not allow for separating brain from non-brain activity.

### Abstract

Based on increasing incidents of mental ill-health associated with living in dense urban environments, the field of Neurourbanism developed rapidly, aiming at identifying and improving urban factors that impact the health of city dwellers. Neurourbanism and the closely related field of Neuro-Architecture have seen a surge in studies using mobile electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the impact of the built and natural environment on human brain activity moving from the laboratory into the real world. This trend predominantly arises from the ready availability of affordable and portable consumer hardware, which not only guarantees operational simplicity but also frequently incorporates automated data analysis functions. This significantly streamlines the process of EEG data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation, seemingly challenging the necessity of specialized expertise in the method of EEG or neurosciences in general. As a consequence, numerous studies in the field of Neurourbanism have used such off-the-shelf systems in laboratory and real-world experimental protocols including active movement of participants through the environment. However, the recording and analysis of EEG data entails numerous requisites, the disregard of which may culminate in errors during data acquisition, processing, and subsequent interpretation, potentially compromising the scientific validity of the outcomes. The often relatively low number of electrodes offered by affordable and portable consumer EEG systems further restricts specific analyses approaches to the low-dimensional EEG data. Crucially, a large part of Neurourbanism studies used black-box analyses provided by such consumer systems or incorrectly applied complex data-driven analyses methods that are incompatible with the recorded low-dimensional data. The current manuscript delineates the prerequisites concerning EEG hardware and analytical methodologies applicable to stationary and mobile EEG protocols, whether conducted within a controlled laboratory environment or in real-world settings. It conducts a comprehensive review of EEG studies within the domain of Neurourbanism and Neuro-Architecture, assessing their adherence to these prerequisites. The findings reveal severe deficiencies in the utilization of hardware and data processing methods, thereby rendering these studies unsuitable for scientific scrutiny. Consequently, the present paper provides guidelines for the selection of EEG hardware and analytical strategies for researchers engaged in mobile EEG recordings, be it within a laboratory or real-world context, aimed at steering future investigations in the field of Neurourbanism and Neuro-Architecture.
