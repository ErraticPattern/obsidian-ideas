> According to the Attention–Restoration Theory (ART)26, it is postulated that urban environments are often accompanied by high levels of stimulation, e.g. moving cars and  people, that require directed attention and lead to directed attention fatigue28.

> We found that the green environment led to higher alpha power than urban indoor and outdoor (both crowded and uncrowded), but the evidence for an effect was substantial only for the standing group. Contrasts between the urban environments revealed a trend for higher alpha in noncrowded environments, and in outdoor compared to indoor, but the evidence was anecdotal.

> We found strong evidence that FMT was higher in the indoor crowded compared to green for the standing group, and higher in the urban outdoor excess for walking in the outdoor uncrowded. We also found that for the standing group, the indoor crowded evoked higher FMT than the indoor uncrowded, and the outdoor uncrowded higher than the indoor uncrowded.

> We found decisive evidence for higher TBR in the crowded space (both outdoor and indoor) compared to the uncrowded scenes, except for the walking group and urban outdoor. TBR was higher in the indoor crowded compared to green for both groups, but higher in the green (vs indoor uncrowded and the outdoor uncrowed) for the standing group. TBR was higher in the crowded condition, apart from the outdoor for the walking group. It was also higher for the indoor crowded compared to outdoor crowded for the standing group.

> Overall, we found that for the standing group FAA was higher in the green compared to indoor crowded and indoor uncrowded; but for the walking group FAA was higher in the outdoor crowded and indoor uncrowded compared to the green. Furthermore, when looking on the effect of crowding we found that FAA was higher in the outdoor crowded compared to uncrowded but higher in the uncrowded compared to crowded for the walking group, whereas for the standing group FAA was higher in the indoor crowded compared to uncrowded. In terms of responses to the urban environments, FAA was higher in the outdoor compared to indoor (both crowded and uncrowded) crowded elicited higher ISCR than the green for the walking group. For the walking group, ISCR was higher in the crowded compared to uncrowded condition (for both indoor and outdoor), and higher in the indoor crowded than the indoor uncrowded. Other contrasts were unclear.

> We show that in a pedestrian context, experiencing a space in higher social density leads to higher self-reported and physiological arousal, and increased cognitive and attentional demands (higher theta/beta ratio). However, although we observed more negative self-reported valence in crowded environments, electrophysiological measures suggest more positive responses to the environments in crowded conditions. Together these findings encourage  additional research into more types of urban environments beyond the nature-urban dichotomy13, and into the  influence of different levels of human activity9.

### Abstract

Environmental psychologists have established multiple psychological benefits of interaction with natural, compared to urban, environments on emotion, cognition, and attention. Yet, given the increasing urbanisation worldwide, it is equally important to understand how differences within different urban environments influence human psychological experience. We developed a laboratory experiment to examine the psychophysiological effects of the physical (outdoor or indoor) and social (crowded versus uncrowded) environment in healthy young adults, and to validate the use of mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements during active walking. Participants (N = 42) were randomly assigned into a walking or a standing group, and watched six 1-min walk-through videos of green, urban indoor and urban outdoor environments, depicting high or low levels of social density. Self-reported emotional states show that green spaces is perceived as more calm and positive, and reduce attentional demands. Further, the outdoor urban space is perceived more positively than the indoor environment. These findings are consistent with earlier studies on the psychological benefits of nature and confirm the effectiveness of our paradigm and stimuli. In addition, we hypothesised that even short-term exposure to crowded scenes would have negative psychological effects. We found that crowded scenes evoked higher self-reported arousal, more negative self-reported valence, and recruited more cognitive and attentional resources. However, in walking participants, they evoked higher frontal alpha asymmetry, suggesting more positive affective responses. Furthermore, we found that using recent signal-processing methods, the EEG data produced a comparable signal-to-noise ratio between walking and standing, and that despite differences between walking and standing, skin-conductance also captured effectively psychophysiological responses to stimuli. These results suggest that emotional responses to visually presented stimuli can be measured effectively using mobile EEG and EDA in ambulatory settings, and that there is complex interaction between active walking, the social density of urban spaces, and direct and indirect affective responses to such environments.
