> During urban scenery viewing, the middle and inferior occipital gyri, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala and lingual gyrus  were predominantly activated as compared to rural scenery viewing.

> The hippocampus is primarily involved in memory processing (Astur and Constable, 2004) and the surrounding parahippocampal gyrus was found to be visually responsive.

> Damage to the parahippocampal area due to stroke often leads to a syndrome where patients cannot visually recognize scenes even though they can recognize individual objects in scenes such as people and furniture (Sato and Nakamura, 2003).

> Interestingly, not only the primary visual cortex (lingual gyrus, middle and inferior occipital gyri) but also the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus show dominant activation under input of negative stimuli during viewing urban pictures.
