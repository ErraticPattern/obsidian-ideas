> Electrode placement is based on four reference points on the head surface: the nasion, the inion, and the left and right preauricular points. “10–20” refers to the distance between adjacent electrodes, that is 10% or 20% of the length inion-nasion and left-right preauricular points.

> Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) are electrical signals time locked to sensory, motor or cognitive stimuli, which reflect the timing of the information processing in the brain. ERP waveforms (components), described on the basis of their amplitude and latency, provide useful information about sensory, cognitive and emotional processes both in healthy and brain-injured subjects.

> The analysis of the N170 ERP component revealed a significantly higher amplitude in the elderly for both emotions, especially at the occipito-temporal sites. The brain source localization, conducted using sLORETA, showed that during the N170 component, for both emotions, the maximum current density of the difference wave between the young and the elderly subjects is located in the same brain region, that is the limbic area.

### Abstract

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive diagnostic technique for recording brain electric activity. The EEG source localization has been an area of research widely explored during the last decades because it provides helpful information about brain physiology and abnormalities. Source localization consists in solving the so-called EEG inverse problem. Over the years, one of the most employed method for solving it has been LORETA (Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography). In particular, in this review, we focused on the findings about the LORETA family algorithms applied to high-density EEGs (HD-EEGs), used for improving the low spatial resolution deriving from the traditional EEG systems. The results were classified according to their clinical application and some aspects arisen from the analyzed papers were discussed. Finally, suggestions were provided for future improvement. In this way, the combination of LORETA with HD-EEGs could become an even more valuable tool for noninvasive clinical evaluation in the field of applied neuroscience.
