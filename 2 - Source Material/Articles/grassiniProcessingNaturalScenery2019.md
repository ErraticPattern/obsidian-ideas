> Comparison of ERPs to natural vs. urban scenery revealed that images of natural scenery elicited a more pronounced P1 wave, and a  more attenuated N1, EPN and P300 waves, compared to images of urban scenery. Images of natural scenery elicited a more pronounced LPP compared to urban ones.

> The ERPs showed a clearly enhanced negativity over occipital areas for images of urban scenery, starting already around 100 ms from stimulus onset. The negativity turned into an enhanced positivity around 400 ms. Finally, the polarity changed again from 500 to 600 ms until the end of the presentation of the stimulus (1200 ms): in this late time-window the images of natural scenery were associated with a larger positive ERP compared to the urban ones.

> Overall, the early ERPs support the attention restoration theory in suggesting lower attentional load in processing images of natural rather than urban scenery scenery.

> On the basis of the attention restoration theory, we expected that images of natural scenery will be experienced as more relaxing than urban ones, which would be reflected as an increase of alpha power and as a decrease of beta power during presentation of nature scenery, compared with urban ones.

> An opposite effect for beta waves suggested that the brain engages in a less intense activity while viewing images of natural scenery than urban ones.

> Low-level visual features may also have represented a bias and therefore a limitation of the present study, as demonstrated by the posthoc analysis of the images colors and luminosity.

> t is not clear from our results, due to a lack of a non-nature and non-urban condition, whether urban environments increase attentional and cognitive demand or if natural ones decrease the attentional and cognitive demand compared to a “neutral” baseline condition.

> electrophysiological results suggest that perception of natural environments, even when depicted in static images, is less attentionally and cognitively demanding for the human brain, compared to perception of urban ones.
