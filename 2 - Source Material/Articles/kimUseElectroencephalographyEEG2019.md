### Abstract

As the necessity for safety and aesthetic of nightscape have arisen, the importance of nightscapes (i.e., nighttime landscape) planning has garnered the attention of mainstream consciousness. Therefore, this study was to suggest the guideline for nightscape planning using electroencephalography (EEG) technology and survey for recognizing the characteristics of a nightscape. Furthermore, we verified the electroencephalography (EEG) method as a tool for landscape evaluation. Therefore, this study analyzed the change of relative alpha wave and relative beta wave and perceived fear of participants depending on twelve nightscape settings (four types of settings: Built nightscape images group with an adult; Built nightscape images groups without an adult; Nature-dominant nightscape images with an adult; and Nature-dominant nightscape images without an adult). Our findings indicate that the most fearful nightscape setting was recorded in Built nightscape images groups without an adult figure in perceived fear result depending on four types of nightscape settings. In Nature-dominant nightscape images, on the other hand, the nightscape setting with an adult figure was more fearful than the setting without an adult. The interaction effect between landscape type (built and nature-dominant) and adult presence towards perceived fear was verified and it showed that the image with adult affects landscape type. For electroencephalography (EEG) results, several brain activities in the relative alpha and beta wave showed significant differences depending on nightscape settings, which situates electroencephalography (EEG) as an invaluable tool for evaluating landscapes. Based on our physiological electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, we provide a new analytic view of the nightscape. The approach we utilized enables a deeper understanding of emotional perception and fear among human subjects by identifying the physical environment which impacts how they experience nightscapes.
