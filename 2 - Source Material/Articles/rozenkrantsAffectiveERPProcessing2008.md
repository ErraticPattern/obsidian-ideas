> Waveforms were averaged off-line, such that trials on which the EEG or EOG exceeded ±100 lV were rejected. Individual subject data were filtered with a 15 Hz low-pass digital filer.

> The major finding was that high-arousal stimuli demonstrated larger ERP amplitudes compared to low-arousal stimuli. This effect began approximately with the N2 (220–300 ms), became appreciably stronger for the P3 (300–450 ms) through the early SW (550–700 ms) potentials, and was still robust for the late SW (700–850 ms) component (Delplanque et al., 2006; Olofsson and Polich, 2007).

> Although the exact sources of affective ERP amplitude modulations are unclear, recent results suggest that physical picture attributes such as color, complexity, and featural composition contribute to affective ERP processing. These early perceptual effects could reflect emotional content, whereas later ERP modulations appear to index fundamental motivational relevance




**Comment**: This could be connected with what Klaus found for the count of green pixels in the images.

> In addition, negative affective valence produces stronger ERP modulation than positive affective valence pictures (Cacioppo et al., 1999; Öhman and Mineka, 2001).

> The potency of negative affect may reflect the rapid processing of aversive information by the amygdala and related structures (Crawford and Cacioppo, 2002; LeDoux, 1995; Morris et al., 1998).
