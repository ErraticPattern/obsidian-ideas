> The LPP ERP component is examined most often with respect to stimulus valence (Bradley et al., 2007; MacNamara et al., 2009, 2011) or perceived pleasantness (Hajcak and Olvet, 2008).

> The EEG data were acquired using the EEG Emotiv headset and TestBench software with 14 channels (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4) using Common Mode Sense active electrode and Driven Right leg passive electrode (CMS/DRL) references at P3/P4; left/right mastoid process alternative.

> Data were filtered (bandpass: 0.1–59 Hz), re-referenced to average scalp reference, and trials containing artifacts were removed algorithmically based on abnormal trend and improbable data

> The assumption of equal variances was not met for the comparisons of overall restorativeness, being away, fascination, extent, and compatibility. Thus, test statistics accounting for this violation have been reported; however, this assumption was met for the coherence comparison, and values for that test are thus unadjusted.




**Comment**: How did they do this adjustment?

> This lack of a significant oddball effect in the current study, though surprising, may also be due to the use of a passive task.




**Comment**: This may be a good indicator that it is a comparable task to a pure passive task of viewing videos
