### Abstract

Human event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 10 subjects presented with visual target and nontarget stimuli at five screen locations and responding to targets presented at one of the locations. The late positive response complexes of 25-75 ERP average waveforms from the two task conditions were simultaneously analyzed with Independent Component Analysis, a new computational method for blindly separating linearly mixed signals. Three spatially fixed, temporally independent, behaviorally relevant, and physiologically plausible components were identified without reference to peaks in single-channel waveforms. A novel frontoparietal component (P3f) began at approximately 140 msec and peaked, in faster responders, at the onset of the motor command. The scalp distribution of P3f appeared consistent with brain regions activated during spatial orienting in functional imaging experiments. A longer-latency large component (P3b), positive over parietal cortex, was followed by a postmotor potential (Pmp) component that peaked 200 msec after the button press and reversed polarity near the central sulcus. A fourth component associated with a left frontocentral nontarget positivity (Pnt) was evoked primarily by target-like distractors presented in the attended location. When no distractors were presented, responses of five faster-responding subjects contained largest P3f and smallest Pmp components; when distractors were included, a Pmp component appeared only in responses of the five slower-responding subjects. Direct relationships between component amplitudes, latencies, and behavioral responses, plus similarities between component scalp distributions and regional activations reported in functional brain imaging experiments suggest that P3f, Pmp, and Pnt measure the time course and strength of functionally distinct brain processes.
