> First, power (the amount of energy in a signal at each frequency) generally follows a “1/f” pattern, meaning that power decreases with increasing frequencies, typically in a supralogarithmic manner. Comparing power across frequencies therefore requires a nonlinear normalization—typically, decibel or percent change.

> Second, because of temporal smoothing inherent in time-frequency analysis methods, a baseline period that ends at time=0 is suboptimal because early post-stimulus activity may “leak” into the estimate of the baseline activity.

> In most situations, a pre-trial baseline period of -500 to -200 ms is sufficient. The choice of baseline should be considered during experiment design.




**Comment**: This is contrary to ERP studies in which a baseline period from -200 to 0 is more suitable (see Luck,2014)

> Have “enough” trials per condition and “enough” subjects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to give precise numbers that would be appropriate for all experiments, because it depends on the effect size and the quality of the data. As a general guideline, I recommend a minimum of 50 trials per condition per subject (ideally >100), and at least 20 subjects.

### Abstract

Cognitive electrophysiology is a subfield of neuroscience that focused on linking M/EEG data to aspects of cognition and the neurophysiological processes that produce them. This field is growing in terms of the novelty and sophistication of findings, data, and data analysis methods. Simultaneously, many areas of modern sciences are experiencing a "replication crisis," prompting discussions of best practices to produce robust and replicable research. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this discussion with a particular focus on cognitive electrophysiology. More issues are raised than are answered. Several recommendations are made, including (1) incorporate replications into new experiments, (2) write clear Methods and Results sections, and (3) publish null results.
