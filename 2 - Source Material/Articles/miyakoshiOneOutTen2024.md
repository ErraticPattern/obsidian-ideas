### Abstract

Abstract
            
              Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used today for scalp‐recorded EEG analysis. One of the limitations of ICA‐based analysis is polarity indeterminacy. It is not easy to find detailed documentations that explains engineering solutions of how the polarity indeterminacy is addressed in a given implementation. We investigated how it is implemented in the case of EEGLAB and also the relation between the outcome of the polarity determination and classification of independent components (ICs) in terms of the estimated nature of the sources (brain, muscle, eye, etc.) using an open database of
              n
               = 212 EEG dataset of resting state recordings. We found that (1) about 91% of ICs showed positive‐dominant IC scalp topographies; (2) positive‐dominant ICs were more associated with brain‐originated signals; (3) positive‐dominant ICs showed more radial (peaked at 10–30 degrees deviations from the radial axis) dipolar projection pattern with less residual variance from fitting the equivalent current dipole. In conclusion, using the EEGLAB's default ICA algorithm, one out of 10 ICs results in flipping its polarity to negative, which is associated with non‐radial dipole orientation with higher residual variance. Thus, we determined EEGLAB biases toward positive polarity in decomposing high‐quality brain ICs.
