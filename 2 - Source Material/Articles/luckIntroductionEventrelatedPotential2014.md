> Data processing procedures that attempt to reveal a specific aspect of brain activity by suppressing “noise” in the data are analogous to treatments designed to suppress the symptoms of an underlying medical problem. As any physician can tell you, treatments always have side effects.

> ERP processing treatments such as filters can also have adverse side effects. According to Luckipedia, common adverse effects of filters include distortion of onset times, distortion of offset times, unexplained peaks, and slight dumbness of conclusions. Less frequent adverse effects of filters include artificial oscillations, wildly incorrect conclusions, public humiliation by reviewers, and grant failure.

> Whenever you look at a set of ERP waveformswhether your own or someone else’s—you should look at the prestimulus baseline activity before looking at anything else.

> Specifically, if the voltage fluctuations in the prestimulus baseline are as big as the experimental effects in the poststimulus period, you should be very skeptical about whether the effects are real (even if they are statistically significant, which will happen for bogus effects one out of every 20 times).

> Second, the baseline will tell you if the waveforms are contaminated by overlapping activity from the previous trial or preparatory activity that occurred before the onset of the stimulus in the present trial. Such effects are not always problematic, but you should definitely think about them.




**Comment**: This is definetely a bigger concern in studies with small ITI.

> I tend to be extremely skeptical about ERP localization, and this chapter reflects that skepticism. Many other researchers are also skeptical about ERP localization (see, e.g., Snyder, 1991), but I am more skeptical than most.

> If the study is looking at relatively early ERP components (<=200 ms), the results could easily be distorted by confounds in the stimuli. In many cases, studies simply fail to counterbalance the stimuli (e.g., using one set of stimuli in one condition and a different set of stimuli in another condition), which is an obvious confound.

### Abstract

Second edition. "A Bradford book." An essential guide to designing, conducting, and analyzing event-related potential (ERP) experiments, completely updated for this edition. The event-related potential (ERP) technique, in which neural responses to specific events are extracted from the EEG, provides a powerful noninvasive tool for exploring the human brain. This volume describes practical methods for ERP research along with the underlying theoretical rationale. It offers researchers and students an essential guide to designing, conducting, and analyzing ERP experiments. This second edition has been completely updated, with additional material, new chapters, and more accessible explanations. Freely available supplementary material, including several online-only chapters, offer expanded or advanced treatment of selected topics. The first half of the book presents essential background information, describing the origins of ERPs, the nature of ERP components, and the design of ERP experiments. The second half of the book offers a detailed treatment of the main steps involved in conducting ERP experiments, covering such topics as recording the EEG, filtering the EEG and ERP waveforms, and quantifying amplitudes and latencies. Throughout, the emphasis is on rigorous experimental design and relatively simple analyses. New material in the second edition includes entire chapters devoted to components, artifacts, measuring amplitudes and latencies, and statistical analysis; updated coverage of recording technologies; concrete examples of experimental design; and many more figures. Online chapters cover such topics as overlap, localization, writing and reviewing ERP papers, and setting up and running an ERP lab. A broad overview of the event-related potential technique -- A closer look at ERPs and ERP components -- Overview of common ERP components -- The design of ERP experiments -- Basic principles of ERP recording -- Artifact rejection and correction -- Basics of Fourier analysis and filtering -- Baseline correction, averaging, and time-frequency analysis -- Quantifying ERP amplitudes and latencies -- Statistical analysis.
