> ICA relies on these three assumptions: (1) Functional independence of cortical regions should be represented by temporal independence of the local field potentials; (2) volume conduction (i.e., signal paths from an EEG source to scalp sensors) and signal mixing process are linear and instantaneous; and (3) the functional mapping of the neocortex is stationary across the recording. If these assumptions hold, the ICA’s spatial filter produces (1) effective sources of EEG as temporally maximally independent signals as well as (2) their linear and instantaneous mixing processes (i.e., volume conduction) that are (3) stationary.

> As a result, 5 of 31 clusters were identified as eye-movement IC clusters for their locations near the edge of ventral frontal brain regions and for their PSD being relatively high at low frequencies with no spectral peak; 7 of 31 clusters were identified as clusters associated with muscle artifacts for their locations outside of the brain or near lower head region and for their characteristic mean spectral plateau above 25 Hz. Thus, 16/31 clusters were identified as clusters associated with brain activity. They showed PSD feature of the 1/f characteristic typical in EEG signals sometimes with peaks in the alpha band (8–13 Hz). Finally, 3/31 clusters were excluded from the analysis as outliers after manually cleaning the other clusters by gathering cluster-inconsistent ICs due to limitations of the algorithm in clustering accuracy.

> Power spectral density (PSD) calculations using fast Fourier transform (FFT) are ubiquitous in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. However, this approach’s drawback is the lack of temporal resolution; hence, sliding window solutions such as short-term Fourier Transform and wavelet transform become necessary for temporal resolution.

### Abstract

Magneto-/Electro-encephalography (M/EEG) commonly uses (fast) Fourier transformation to compute power spectral density (PSD). However, the resulting PSD plot lacks temporal information, making interpretation sometimes equivocal. For example, consider two different PSDs: a central parietal EEG PSD with twin peaks at 10 Hz and 20 Hz and a central parietal PSD with twin peaks at 10 Hz and 50 Hz. We can assume the first PSD shows a mu rhythm and the second harmonic; however, the latter PSD likely shows an alpha peak and an independent line noise. Without prior knowledge, however, the PSD alone cannot distinguish between the two cases. To address this limitation of PSD, we propose using cross-frequency power–power coupling (PPC) as a post-processing of independent component (IC) analysis (ICA) to distinguish brain components from muscle and environmental artifact sources. We conclude that post-ICA PPC analysis could serve as a new data-driven EEG classifier in M/EEG studies. For the reader’s convenience, we offer a brief literature overview on the disparate use of PPC. The proposed cross-frequency power–power coupling analysis toolbox (PowPowCAT) is a free, open-source toolbox, which works as an EEGLAB extension.
