> It can be posited that the use of hdEEG is of added value as compared to MEG, primarily due to the possibility of combining it with brain stimulation [8,9] and other brain imaging techniques [10–12], as well as of using it in a remote setting (e.g. during free walking) [13–15].

> Oftencited drawbacks of using MATLAB are the speed limitation compared to compiled languages and the less efficient memory usage. MATLAB code needs to be interpreted at runtime and is therefore not optimized for the hardware it is running on. Memory usage needs to be considered with large input datasets because MATLAB converts all floating-point numbers to 64-bit double-precision. These limitations are mitigated by the fact that several functions in NET are written in C/C ++ and compiled for the CPU architecture.

> The available analyses are grouped in two main categories: i) activity analysis, to examine if neural activity of specific brain regions is modulated by task conditions; ii) connectivity analysis, to test if the neural activities of two or more brain regions are dependent on each other, either during task or during resting state.

> he activity in each voxel has three spatial components, but in most cases a single time-course for each voxel is required. For this reason, a second spatial filter is built for each voxel by using principal component analysis (PCA). This filter projects the neural signals along the spatial direction with maximum signal variance, i.e. the one associated with the first principal component [66,67].

> The first step for the identification of brain network maps is the voxel-by-voxel calculation of the power envelopes in a frequency band of interest. The band-limited power envelopes are then processed using ICA to estimate patterns of coherent power changes. Each independent component (IC) is composed of a time-course and a spatial map. IC maps can be reconstructed for one frequency band or jointly for multiple frequency bands.

### Abstract

Introduction
High-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) is a technique used for the characterization of the neural activity and connectivity in the human brain. The analysis of EEG data involves several steps, including signal pre-processing, head modelling, source localization and activity/connectivity quantification. Visual check of the analysis steps is often necessary, making the process time- and resource-consuming and, therefore, not feasible for large datasets.
Findings
Here we present the Noninvasive Electrophysiology Toolbox (NET), an open-source software for large-scale analysis of hdEEG data, running on the cross-platform MATLAB environment. NET combines all the tools required for a complete hdEEG analysis workflow, from raw signals to final measured values. By relying on reconstructed neural signals in the brain, NET can perform traditional analyses of time-locked neural responses, as well as more advanced functional connectivity and brain mapping analyses. The extracted quantitative neural data can be exported to provide broad compatibility with other software.
Conclusions
NET is freely available (https://github.com/bind-group-kul/net) under the GNU public license for non-commercial use and open-source development, together with a graphical user interface (GUI) and a user tutorial. While NET can be used interactively with the GUI, it is primarily aimed at unsupervised automation to process large hdEEG datasets efficiently. Its implementation creates indeed a highly customizable program suitable for analysis automation and tight integration into existing workflows.
