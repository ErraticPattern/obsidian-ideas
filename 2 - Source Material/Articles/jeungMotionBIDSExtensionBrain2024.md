> (i) It provides a flexible way to define what is construed as a single motion tracking system, agnostic to the type of recording technology used. (ii) It requires users to share metadata that are the most central to interpretation of motion data. (iii) By embedding motion data in the BIDS framework, it supports the growing junction between biomechanics and human neuro- and behavioral science.

> BIDS aims to promote reproducibility of findings, data reusability, and general research efficiency. Broadly, BIDS specifies (i) which data to include in a data set, (ii) how to organize it over directories and files, (iii) the naming of files, and importantly (iv) the organization and format of metadata to complement the data.

> In human behavioral research, biomechanical features extracted from motion data, such as gait patterns, provide insights into underlying cognitive processes and have diagnostic value. For example, step length is related to the severity of Parkinson’s disease. Cognitive impairment in older adults is associated with gait slowing and the prevalence of falls.

### Abstract

We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of hardware and software systems for motion data. This promotes findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data sharing and Open Science in human motion research.
