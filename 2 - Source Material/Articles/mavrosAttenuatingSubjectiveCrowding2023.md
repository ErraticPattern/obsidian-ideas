> Although there is extensive research on the negative psychological effects of crowding, such as increased stress, cognitive load, and negative affect (Blut and Iyer, 2020; Schneider et al., 2023), in some cases a certain degree of crowding may enhance the subjective experience of an environment. For instance, in urban planning it is considered that "the presence of people in a space is interpreted as indicative that a public space is functioning and healthy" (Gehl, 2013; Honey-Rosés et al., 2021).

> Nature-related features, such as the number of trees (Parsons and Daniel, 2002; Hands and Brown, 2002), presence of flowers (White and Gatersleben, 2011) and water features (Faggi et al., 2013; Voelker and Kistemann, 2013), but also other types of interventions such as pedestrianisation (Bornioli et al., 2018) also tend to improve psychological reactions.

> Conversely, exposure to built environment is associated with less positive and more negative emotions (Yao et al., 2021)

> Furthermore, numerous neuroscientific studies have shown that exposure to green spaces, compared to urban, are associated with different patterns of brain activity indicative of lower arousal and reduced attentional load, such as increased power in the alpha (8-13Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) frequency bands (e.g. Grassini, 2022; Mavros et al., 2022; Olszewska-Guizzo et al., 2021).

> ample research has focused on this ’urban vs nature dichotomy’ (Karmanov and Hamel, 2008), it is increasingly recognised that aesthetic, design, social and other qualities of both green/natural and urban/built environments can also modulate the subjective experience, emotional reactions and environmental preferences of people.

> Due to increasing urbanisation worldwide, researchers are interested to understand what aspects of the built environment itself can improve mental and physical wellbeing (Saarloos et al., 2011; Guzman et al., 2021; Buttazzoni et al., 2021).

> Neale et al. (2021) found that in nature, restorative effects persist with and without other people (walkers), but the study involved only 7 other people (confederates) which was relatively low.

> In a study comparing high versus low crowds in a downtown urban environment, Mavros et al. (2022) found that participants reported more negative emotions and higher arousal, accompanied with higher indices of physiological arousal and EEG markers of cognitive load.

> There is an inverse-U relationship between levels of pedestrian crowding and affective experience, i.e., moderate levels of pedestrian crowding lead to more positive emotions.
