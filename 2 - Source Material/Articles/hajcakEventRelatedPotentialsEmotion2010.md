> The P300 has been studied most extensively in “oddball” tasks, in which participants are asked to count or otherwise keep track of certain target stimuli, which are presented infrequently among other standard stimuli;

> The increased LPP for emotional compared to neutral pictures has been shown to be larger for more intense stimuli (i.e., those rated as more arousing and prompting the largest skin conductance changes; Cuthbert et al., 2000), and is larger for highly arousing pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, such as erotica and threat scenes, respectively (Schupp, Junghöfer et al., 2004; Schupp, Ohman et al., 2004; Schupp, Cuthbert et al., 2004).

> In addition, the increased LPP observed for emotional compared to neutral stimuli does not appear to habituate over repeated presentations of stimuli (Codispoti, Ferrari, & Bradley, 2006, 2007; Olofsson & Polich, 2007)

> A recent study that combined ERP and fMRI methods indicated that the magnitude of the LPP elicited by emotional stimuli corresponded to increased blood flow in occipital, parietal, and inferotemporal regions in the brain (Sabatinelli, Lang, Keil, & Bradley, 2007).
