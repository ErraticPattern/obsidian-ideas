**Comment**: Unlike in a simple circuit model where delays in signal propagation occur only at the circuit elements, in the brain there both local delays (e.g. cell bodies) and global delays (axons) due to axonal finite speed of propagation.

**Comment**: The word "field" refers to mathematical functions expressing, for example, the numbers of active synaptic or action potentials in macroscopic tissue volumes. Alternately, probability of neural firing in a tissue mass may be treated as a field variable. In the view adopted in this book, cell assemblies are pictured as embedded within synaptic and action potential fields.

**Comment**: The amplitude of
scalp alpha oscillations is typically 20 to 50 g V, when measured between
one electrode over the occipital cortex and a second electrode some 5 to
10 cm or so distant. Alpha rhythm amplitudes are typically smaller over
frontal regions, depending partly on the subject's state of relaxation.

**Comment**: A posterior rhythm of approximately 4 Hz develops in babies in the first few months of age. Its amplitude increases with eye closure and is believed to be a precursor of mature alpha rhythms.

**Comment**: Important information regarding [[Neuropathology]]: Alpha rhythms provide an appropriate starting point for clinical EEG exams (Kellaway 1979; Niedermeyer and Lopes da Silva 1999). Some initial clinical questions are as follows. Does the patient show an alpha rhythm with eyes closed, especially over posterior scalp? Are its spatial-temporal characteristics appropriate for the patient's age? How does it react to eyes opening, hyperventilation, drowsiness, and so forth? For example, pathology is often associated with pronounced differences in EEG recorded over opposite hemispheres or with low alpha frequencies. A resting alpha frequency lower than about 8 Hz in adults is considered abnormal in all but the very old.

**Comment**: Alpha rhythms can also exhibit both local and global behavior, possibly suggesting that larger amplitudes tend to occur in regions where both local and global mechanisms contribute strongly.

### Abstract

Electroencephalography (EEG) is practiced by neurologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and others interested in functional brain imaging. Whether for clinical or experimental purposes, all studies share a common purpose-to relate scalp potentials to the underlying neurophysiology. Electrical potentials on the scalp exhibit spatial and temporal patterns that depend on the nature and location of the sources and the way that currents and fields spread through tissue. Because these dynamic patterns are correlated with behavior and cognition, EEG provides a "window on the mind," correlating physiology and psychology. This classic and widely acclaimed text, originally published in 1981, filled the large gap between EEG and the physical sciences. It has now been brought completely up to date and will again serve as an invaluable resource for understanding the principles of electric fields in living tissue and for using hard science to study human consciousness and cognition. No comparable volume exists for it is no easy task to explain the problems of EEG in clear language, with mathematics presented mainly in appendices. Among the many topics covered by the Second Edition are micro and meso (intermediate scale) synaptic sources, electrode placement, choice of reference, volume conduction, power and coherence measures, projection of scalp potentials to dura surface, dynamic signatures of conscious experience, neural networks immersed in global fields of synaptic action, and physiological bases for brain source dynamics. The Second Edition is an invaluable resource for neurologists, neuroscientists (especially cognitive neuroscientists), biomedical engineers, and their students and trainees. It will also appeal to physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, psychiatrists, and industrial engineers interested in EEG.
