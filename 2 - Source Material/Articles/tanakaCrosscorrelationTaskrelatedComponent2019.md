> Evoked potentials are both time-locked and phase-locked to event onsets and are obtained by calculating an average across trials in the time domain, assuming that trial-by-trial variability results from additive noises, which are canceled by temporal averaging

> In contrast, induced potentials are similarly time-locked but not phases-locked from trial to trial, so they cancel out each other after averaging in the time domain
