**Comment**: It seems this criterion is usually around plus minus 100 microvolts.

> Although ERPs are modulated state factors including circadian rhythm (Munte, Heinze, Kunkel, & Scholz, 1987), sleep deprivation (Boonstra, Stins, Daffertshofer, & Beek, 2007; Murphy, Richard, Masaki, & Segalowitz, 2006), and mood (e.g., Cavanagh & Geisler, 2006; Olvert & Hajcak, in press), they should exhibit substantial consistency over time if they index stable neurophysiological traits.




**Comment**: Remember they are state dependent.

### Abstract

Event-related potentials (ERPs) offer unparalleled temporal sensitivity in tracing the distinct electrocortical processing stages enabling cognition and are frequently utilized in clinical and experimental investigations, yet few studies have investigated their retest reliability. We administered a battery of typical ERP paradigms to elicit a diverse range of components linked to distinct perceptual and cognitive processes (P1, N1, N170, P3a, P3b, error-related negativity, error positivity, P400). Twenty-five participants completed the battery on two occasions, 1 month apart. Analysis of component amplitudes indicated moderate-to-strong split-half and strong test-retest reliability. Peak latency reliability varied substantially across components and ranged from weak to strong. We confirm that a range of prominent ERPs provide highly stable neurophysiological indices of human cognitive function.
