[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LAXNZMCM?page=4&annotation=9HNLBU6V) “Based on current research findings in the applied literature, it seems appropriate to revise the rules of thumb for effect sizes to now define [[Cohen's d]](.01) = very small, d (.2) = small, d (.5) = medium, d (.8) = large, d (1.2) = very large, and d (2.0) = huge. Hence, the list of conditions of an appropriate Monte Carlo study or simulation (Sawilowsky, 2003) should be expanded to incorporate these new minimum and maximum effect sizes, as well as appropriate values between the two end points.” ([Sawilowsky, 2009, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/ZY8DYNN6))# Annotations

([Sawilowsky, 2009, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/ZY8DYNN6)) The observed [[Effect Size]] of 1.18 can therefore be described as “large” to “very large”.
