> Based on current research findings in the applied literature, it seems appropriate to revise the rules of thumb for effect sizes to now define d (.01) = very small, d (.2) = small, d (.5) = medium, d (.8) = large, d (1.2) = very large, and d (2.0) = huge. Hence, the list of conditions of an appropriate Monte Carlo study or simulation (Sawilowsky, 2003) should be expanded to incorporate these new minimum and maximum effect sizes, as well as appropriate values between the two end points.

**Comment**: The observed effect size of 1.18 can therefore be described as “large” to “very large”.

## Appendix

### Authors


- [[Shlomo S. Sawilowsky]] (author)



### Abstract

Recommendations to expand Cohen’s (1988) rules of thumb for interpreting effect sizes are given to include very small, very large, and huge effect sizes. The reasons for the expansion, and implications for designing Monte Carlo studies, are discussed.
