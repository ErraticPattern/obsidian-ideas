> With whole head coverage in an optimal geodesic pattern, a 256-channel dense array provides ∼2 cm sensor spacing for a medium sized adult head. To achieve ∼1 cm intersensor distances, roughly 500 channels would be needed.

> With estimates of the skull:brain conductivity ratio of 15:1,  half-sensitivity volume estimations suggest that approximately 500 channels are required for adequate spatial sampling of the human EEG (Malmivuo and Suihko, 2004; Ryynänen et al., 2004, 2006).

> Systematic comparisons of varying sensor sampling density and coverage of the surface of the head showed that error in  electrical source estimation can be reduced by using a sufficient number of EEG sensors (128 or 256) as well as by distributing these over inferior head regions (including the face and neck) as well as the top of the head.
