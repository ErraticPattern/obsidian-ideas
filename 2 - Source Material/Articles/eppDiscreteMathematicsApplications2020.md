### Abstract

DISCRETE MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS, 5th Edition, Metric Edition explains complex, abstract concepts with clarity and precision and provides a strong foundation for computer science and upper-level mathematics courses of the computer age. Author Susanna Epp presents not only the major themes of discrete mathematics, but also the reasoning that underlies mathematical thought. Students develop the ability to think abstractly as they study the ideas of logic and proof. While learning about such concepts as logic circuits and computer addition, algorithm analysis, recursive thinking, computability, automata, cryptography and combinatorics, students discover that the ideas of discrete mathematics underlie and are essential to today's science and technology.
