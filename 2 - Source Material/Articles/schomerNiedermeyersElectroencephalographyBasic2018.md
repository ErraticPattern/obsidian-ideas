> The history of electroencephalography (EEG) begins with the discovery of bioelectrical phenomena. The ancient Greeks (in about 1000 BC) started to open trade routes across the Black Sea, via the river Dnieper, to the Baltic region. Among many trade items that the Greeks obtained from the Baltic was a fossilized pine resin which they called “electron,” but which we nowadays call amber. The ancient Greek philosopher Thales of Miletos, one of the pre-Socratic “natural philosophers” of Greece (around 620–550 BC), discovered that amber had the ability to attract light objects when it was rubbed with fur.

> In 1937, Berger was invited to an international congress of psychologists in Paris and to Bologna, where the bicentennial of Galvani’s birthday was celebrated. Berger’s relationship to the Nazi regime was not good and he was unceremoniously made a professor emeritus at earliest convenience in 1938 at the age of 65 (a few additional “years of honor” were granted to most retiring directors of university institutions). This was indeed a hard blow to his plans for further EEG studies and, in the wake of a flulike disease, he evidently developed a severe endogenous depression, which remained undiagnosed. He ended his life by suicide on June 1, 1941, at the age of 68. Additional external factors may have contributed to Berger’s depression: he felt deeply challenged by a group of  independent EEG workers at the Institute of Brain Research at BerlinBuch.

### Abstract

Niedermeyer's Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields, Seventh Edition keeps the clinical neurophysiologist on the forefront of medical advancements. This authoritative text covers basic neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, and neuroimaging to provide a better understanding of clinical neurophysiological findings. This edition further delves into current state-of-the-art recording EEG activity both in the normal clinical environment and unique situations such as the intensive care unit, operating rooms, and epilepsy monitoring suites. As computer technology evolves, so does the integration of analytical methods that significantly affect the reader's interpretations of waveforms and trends that are occurring on long-term monitoring sessions. Compiled and edited by Donald L. Schomer and Fernando H. Lopes da Silva, along with a global team of experts, they collectively bring insight to crucial sections including basic principles of EEG and MEG, normal EEG, EEG in a clinical setting, clinical EEG in seizures and epilepsy, complementary and special techniques, event-related EEG phenomena, and shed light on the future of EEG and clinical neurophysiology. Akin to an encyclopedia of everything EEG, this comprehensive work is perfect for neurophysiology fellows, as well as neurology, neurosurgery, and general medical residents, and for the interns and medical students, and is a one-stop-shop for anyone training in EEG or preparing for neurophysiology or epilepsy board exams.
