These three types of error have different properties and, thus, fit into different parts of a typical optical analysis stream.” ([Huppert et al., 2009, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/58LU6WP9))

For example, experimental errors may arise as the result of subject motion or noncompliance with the stimulus paradigm.” ([Huppert et al., 2009, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/58LU6WP9))
