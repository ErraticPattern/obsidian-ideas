> Permutation tests date back to the early 20th century (Good, 2005) and are based on the insight that if two sets of samples are drawn from a single population of individuals the different observations are ‘‘exchangeable.’’ Exchanging a pair of observations is equivalent to swapping experimental condition labels.

### Abstract

Abstract
            
              Event‐related potentials (ERPs) and magnetic fields (ERFs) are typically analyzed via ANOVAs on mean activity in
              a priori
              windows. Advances in computing power and statistics have produced an alternative, mass univariate analyses consisting of thousands of statistical tests and powerful corrections for multiple comparisons. Such analyses are most useful when one has little
              a priori
              knowledge of effect locations or latencies, and for delineating effect boundaries. Mass univariate analyses complement and, at times, obviate traditional analyses. Here we review this approach as applied to ERP/ERF data and four methods for multiple comparison correction: strong control of the familywise error rate (FWER) via permutation tests, weak control of FWER via cluster‐based permutation tests, false discovery rate control, and control of the generalized FWER. We end with recommendations for their use and introduce free MATLAB software for their implementation.
