> Studies that have attempted to localize the neural sources of these ERPs find that the EPN is likely driven by lateral occipital extrastriate activity ( Junghöfer et al., 2006; Schupp, Stockburger, et al., 2006) whereas the LPP may represent a combination of activity from multiple dorsal and ventral visual cortical regions, as well as anterior cortical sources (Sabatinelli, Keil, Frank, & Lang, 2013; Liu, Hairston, Schrier, & Fan, 2011; Moratti, Saugar, & Strange, 2011).

### Abstract

Abstract
            The early posterior negativity (EPN) is a mid-latency ERP component that is reliably enhanced by emotional cues, with a deflection beginning between 150 and 200 msec after stimulus onset. The brief, bilateral occipital EPN is followed by the centroparietal late positive potential (LPP), a long duration slow-wave that is strongly associated with emotional arousal ratings of scenes. A recent study suggests that the EPN is particularly sensitive to human bodies in scenes, independent of emotional intensity. Here, we directly investigate the influence of human body features on EPN modulation, using emotional and neutral scenes depicting people across a range of body exposures and orientations, in addition to scenes of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant animals. The results demonstrate that the EPN is quite sensitive to human body features and weakly related to arousal ratings, whereas the LPP is strongly modulated by scenes that receive high arousal ratings. Based on these results and relevant work on body-specific visual perception, we speculate that modulation of the EPN may strongly reflect the early detection of human bodies, which serves as a predictor of emotional significance, whereas LPP modulation is more closely associated with the extended elaborative processing of scenes that are explicitly judged to be emotionally arousing.
