> Studies of asymmetry can be classified as one of four types: (1) studies examining frontal EEG asymmetry as an individual difference that is related to other traits or trait-like measures; (2) Studies examining frontal EEG asymmetry as an individual difference that can predict state-related emotional changes and responses; (3) Studies examining frontal EEG asymmetry as an individual difference that is related to psychopathology or risk for psychopathology, especially depression and anxiety; and (4) Studies examining state-related change in asymmetry as a function of state changes in emotion.

### Abstract

Frontal EEG asymmetry appears to serve as (1) an individual difference variable related to emotional responding and emotional disorders, and (2) a state-dependent concomitant of emotional responding. Such findings, highlighted in this review, suggest that frontal EEG asymmetry may serve as both a moderator and a mediator of emotion- and motivation-related constructs. Unequivocal evidence supporting frontal EEG asymmetry as a moderator and/or mediator of emotion is lacking, as insufficient attention has been given to analyzing the frontal EEG asymmetries in terms of moderators and mediators. The present report reviews the frontal EEG asymmetry literature from the framework of moderators and mediators, and overviews data analytic strategies that would support claims of moderation and mediation.
