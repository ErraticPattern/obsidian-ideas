> In addition to implicit tagging using behavioral cues, multiple studies used multimedia content analysis (MCA) for automated affective tagging of videos. Hanjalic and Xu [29] introduced “personalized content delivery” as a valuable tool in affective indexing and retrieval systems.

> Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed that low and high arousal stimuli induced different valence ratings (p<0:0001 and p<0:00001). Similarly, low and high valenced stimuli induced different arousal ratings (p<0:001 and p<0:0001).

> Interestingly, this results in a Cshape of the stimuli on the valence-arousal plane also observed in the well-validated ratings for the IAPS [18] and the international affective digital sounds system (IADS) [38], indicating the general difficulty in inducing emotions with strong valence, but low arousal.

> For arousal we found negative correlations in the theta, alpha, and gamma bands. The central alpha power decrease for higher arousal matches the findings from our earlier pilot study [35] and an inverse relationship between alpha power and the general level of arousal has been reported before [41], [42]. Valence showed the strongest correlations with EEG signals and correlates were found in all analyzed frequency bands. In the low frequencies, theta and alpha, an increase of valence led to an increase of power.

> right temporal increase of power. Increased beta power over right temporal sites was associated with positive emotional self-induction and external stimulation in [44]. Similarly, Onton and Makeig [45] have reported a positive correlation of valence and high-frequency power, including beta and gamma bands, emanating from anterior temporal cerebral sources. Correspondingly, we observed a highly significant increase of left and especially right temporal gamma power.

### Abstract

We present a multimodal data set for the analysis of human affective states. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals of 32 participants were recorded as each watched 40 one-minute long excerpts of music videos. Participants rated each video in terms of the levels of arousal, valence, like/dislike, dominance, and familiarity. For 22 of the 32 participants, frontal face video was also recorded. A novel method for stimuli selection is proposed using retrieval by affective tags from the last.fm website, video highlight detection, and an online assessment tool. An extensive analysis of the participants' ratings during the experiment is presented. Correlates between the EEG signal frequencies and the participants' ratings are investigated. Methods and results are presented for single-trial classification of arousal, valence, and like/dislike ratings using the modalities of EEG, peripheral physiological signals, and multimedia content analysis. Finally, decision fusion of the classification results from different modalities is performed. The data set is made publicly available and we encourage other researchers to use it for testing their own affective state estimation methods.
