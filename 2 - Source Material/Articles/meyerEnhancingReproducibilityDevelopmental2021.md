> A clear advantage of using nonparametric tests, like the cluster-based permutation test, is that any test statistic can be used to investigate the difference between different conditions or the relationship between data and an independent variable. Thereby the statistical sensitivity is increased while also mitigating the risks of multiple comparisons and minimizing false negatives

> any participant for whom more than 70% of the trials were rejected was excluded from the analysis (Script Section 2.1). This was based on the rationale that with the removal of 70% of the trials (i.e. a reductionto 0.3 times N) the expected standard error of the mean (SEM) in this within-subject design is approximately 2 times larger than the SEM over the full N

> More pre cisely, we calculated three effect size measures, each based on slightly different parts of the data, and thereby differing in their information content. For all three options, we used Cohen’s d as estimate separately computed for the positive and negative clusters in our infant EEG data.

### Abstract

Developmental research using electroencephalography (EEG) offers valuable insights in brain processes early in life, but at the same time, applying this sensitive technique to young children who are often non-compliant and have short attention spans comes with practical limitations. It is thus of particular importance to optimally use the limited resources to advance our understanding of development through reproducible and replicable research practices. Here, we describe methodological approaches that help maximize the reproducibility of developmental EEG research. We discuss how to transform EEG data into the standardized Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) which organizes data according to the FAIR data sharing principles. We provide a tutorial on how to use cluster-based permutation testing to analyze developmental EEG data. This versatile test statistic solves the multiple comparison problem omnipresent in EEG analysis and thereby substantially decreases the risk of reporting false discoveries. Finally, we describe how to quantify effect sizes, in particular of cluster-based permutation results. Reporting effect sizes conveys a finding’s impact and robustness which in turn informs future research. To demonstrate these methodological approaches to data organization, analysis and report, we use a publicly accessible infant EEG dataset and provide a complete copy of the analysis code.
