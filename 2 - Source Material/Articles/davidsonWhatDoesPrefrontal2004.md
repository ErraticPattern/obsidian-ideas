> One unwitting consequence of the work my laboratory began on prefrontal asymmetries and affect is the view that the prefrontal cortex is the “center” or at least the primary region for all aspects of the emotional and/or motivational processes in question.

> variations in electrode impedance cannot account for any detectable difference in signals across electrodes using modern high impedance amplifiers. This is true in all but one circumstance and that is when electrodes are linked prior to inputting the signal into the amplifier (Senulis and Davidson, 1989).




**Comment**: This means that when computing asymmetry features the reference type must be carefully chosen.

### Abstract

This commentary provides reflections on the current state of affairs in research on EEG frontal asymmetries associated with affect. Although considerable progress has occurred since the first report on this topic 25 years ago, research on frontal EEG asymmetries associated with affect has largely evolved in the absence of any serious connection with neuroscience research on the structure and function of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC). Such integration is important as this work progresses since the neuroscience literature can help to understand what the prefrontal cortex is “doing” in affective processing. Data from the neuroscience literature on the heterogeneity of different sectors of the PFC are introduced and more specific hypotheses are offered about what different sectors of the PFC might be doing in affect. A number of methodological issues associated with EEG measures of functional prefrontal asymmetries are also considered.
