> Other artifactual contributions to the recording are even less welcome. For example movement in mobile protocols might lead to mechanical artifacts like cable sway or micro movement of electrodes that contribute artifactual activity into the recording. Finally, environmental sources and the equipment necessary for the experiment itself like head mounted virtual reality (VR) systems or treadmills can be another unavoidable source of electrical artifacts in mobile recordings.

> Mechanical and electrical artifacts do not correlate highly with physiological recordings and thus are typically easier to  detect and to remove than physiological contributions (Chang et al., 2020). The dissociation of potentially correlating physiological sources (brain, eyes, and muscles) is more difficult.

### Abstract

Recent developments in EEG hardware and analyses approaches allow for recordings in both stationary and mobile settings. Irrespective of the experimental setting, EEG recordings are contaminated with noise that has to be removed before the data can be functionally interpreted. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a commonly used tool to remove artifacts such as eye movement, muscle activity, and external noise from the data and to analyze activity on the level of EEG effective brain sources. The effectiveness of filtering the data is one key preprocessing step to improve the decomposition that has been investigated previously. However, no study thus far compared the different requirements of mobile and stationary experiments regarding the preprocessing for ICA decomposition. We thus evaluated how movement in EEG experiments, the number of channels, and the high-pass filter cutoff during preprocessing influence the ICA decomposition. We found that for commonly used settings (stationary experiment, 64 channels, 0.5 Hz filter), the ICA results are acceptable. However, high-pass filters of up to 2 Hz cut-off frequency should be used in mobile experiments, and more channels require a higher filter to reach an optimal decomposition. Fewer brain ICs were found in mobile experiments, but cleaning the data with ICA has been proved to be important and functional even with low-density channel setups. Based on the results, we provide guidelines for different experimental settings that improve the ICA decomposition.
