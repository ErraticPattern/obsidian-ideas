> Traditional EEG analysis methods such as trial-averaging typically only considers the time course of individual channels. Thus, the increased number of sensors has created a need for tools that can analyze the time series of multiple electrodes simultaneously.

> The methods presented in this paper avoid making any spatial modeling assumptions with regard to the sources or anatomy. They instead rely entirely on the statistics of the observed data and its covariation with observable stimuli and behavioral responses.




**Comment**: I think EEG methods can be broadly categorized by this criteria.

### Abstract

In this paper, we describe a simple set of “recipes” for the analysis of high spatial density EEG. We focus on a linear integration of multiple channels for extracting individual components without making any spatial or anatomical modeling assumptions, instead requiring particular statistical properties such as maximum difference, maximum power, or statistical independence. We demonstrate how corresponding algorithms, for example, linear discriminant analysis, principal component analysis and independent component analysis, can be used to remove eye-motion artifacts, extract strong evoked responses, and decompose temporally overlapping components. The general approach is shown to be consistent with the underlying physics of EEG, which specifies a linear mixing model of the underlying neural and non-neural current sources.
