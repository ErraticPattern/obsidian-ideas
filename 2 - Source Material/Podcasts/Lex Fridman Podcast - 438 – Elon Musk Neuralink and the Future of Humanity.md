And that’s one of the things that I really enjoyed about my graduate school career, where you got to kind of pursue your intellectual curiosity in the domain that may not matter at the end of the day, but is something that really allows you the opportunity to go as deeply as you want, as well as widely as you want. And at the time I was actually working on this project called the Smart Bandaid, and the idea was that when you get a wound, there’s a lot of other proliferation of signaling pathway that cells follow to close that wound. And there were hypotheses that when you apply external [[electric field]], you can actually accelerate the closing of that field by having basically electro taxing of the cells around that wound site.

- [ ] What is electro-taxing? Can EM fields actually accelerate wound closure.

>  And the general good rule of thumb is that you want the [wavefront](obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=mathematics&filepath=Physics%252FWave.md) to be roughly on the order of the size of the thing that you’re interfacing with. So an implantable system that is around 10 to a hundred micron in dimension in a volume, which is about the size of a neuron that you see in a human body, you would have to operate at hundreds of gigahertz. Which number one, not only is it difficult to build electronics operating at those frequencies, but also the body just attenuates to that very, very significantly.

- [ ] Luigi Galvani
- [ ] Hans Berger 
- [ ] Renshaw, Forbes and Morison that inserted these glass micro electrodes into the cortex and recorded single neurons.
- [ ]  These two scientists, Hodgkin and Huxley showed up and they built this beautiful, beautiful models of the cell membrane and the ionic mechanism, and had these circuit diagram.
- [ ] So in 1969, Eb Fetz from University of Washington published this beautiful paper called Operant Conditioning of Cortical Unit Activity, where he was able to record a single unit neuron from a monkey and was able to have the monkey modulated based on its activity and reward system.

>  And the two dominant physics for this electrical recording domain is diffusion physics and electromagnetism. And where one dominates, where Maxwell’s equation dominates versus Fick’s law dominates depends on where your electrode is. If it’s close to the source, mostly [electromagnetic-based](obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=mathematics&filepath=Notes%252FElectromagnetic%2520Waves.md). When you’re further away from it, it’s more [diffusion-based](obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=mathematics&filepath=Notes%252FDiffusion%2520Physics.md).

>[!quote]
> The moment you’re further away, and based on some of the studies that people have done, Christof Koch’s lab, and others, once you’re away from that source by roughly around a hundred micron, which is about a width of a human hair, you no longer hear from that [[Neuron]]. You’re no longer able to have the system sensitive enough to be able to record that particular local membrane potential change in that neuron. [...]   so a hundred micron by a hundred micron by a hundred micron box in a [[Brain Parenchima]], there’s roughly around 40 neurons, and whatever number of connections that they have. So there’s a lot in that volume of tissue. So the moment you’re outside of that, there’s just no hope that you’ll be able to detect that change from that one specific neuron that you may care about.

>  So similar to how when you have electromagnetic waves propagating in atmosphere or in a charged medium like a plasma, there’s this weird [shielding](obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=mathematics&filepath=Notes%252FElectromagnetic%2520Shielding.md) that happens that actually further attenuates the signal as you move away from it. So yeah, you see, if you do a really, really deep dive on the signal attenuation over distance, you start to see one over R square in the beginning and then exponential drop off, and that’s the knee at which you go from electromagnetism dominating to diffusion physic dominating.

> [...] each electrode can record from anywhere between zero to 40, as I mentioned earlier. But practically speaking, we only see about at most two to three, and you can actually distinguish which neuron it’s coming from by the shape of the spikes.

> And then also the way in which we measure the health of the electrodes or whether they’re in the brain or not, is by measuring impedance of the electrode. So we look at the interfacial, the [Randles circuit](obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=mathematics&filepath=Notes%252FRandles%2520circuit.md) they say, the [[capacitance]] and the [[resistance]] between the [[electrode]] surface and the medium.
