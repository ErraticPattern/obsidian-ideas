## Transcript:
- [00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1s) this video is about figures for research papers specifically about the principles of beautiful and professional figures we will consider multiple examples of real figures with a focus on design problems and things that can be improved by the end of this video you will learn the main graphic design principles for academic Publications such as using vector-based images selecting harmonious color schemes optimizing layout and anymore so let's try to understand what makes a figure beautiful and [Music] professional hi everyone my name is
- [00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=43s) Andre I'm researcher at Imperial College London it's been a while since my last video I was busy moving to London attending summer conferences writing papers of course and so on now I'm back and I have time for making more videos this is my new open space at Imperial I think it looks great for YouTube videos so please let me know if you like this background usually on this channel I discuss various aspects and problems of Academia and today I want to start a big series of videos maybe we can call them
- [01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=76s) tutorials on a very important topic of how to develop how to create beautiful figures for research papers but first let me tell you about my experience and why I want to talk about this topic you see throughout my my academic career I have read and reviewed hundreds of academic papers as a reviewer I usually analyzed figures of other authors I found some mistakes and wrote comments to the authors and then through this review process the authors were changing figures and I really learned a lot from this iterative review process and then I
- [01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=112s) implemented this knowledge in my own papers and I I'm constantly trying to improve the quality of figures in my own manuscripts and second I have recently read this famous book by Cole Klick called storytelling with data I really enjoyed reading it and recommend it to anyone who is interested in data visualization so today we will discuss a few Concepts from this book as well surprisingly many universities Overlook the topic of developing beautiful figures and many students and young researchers have to learn graphic
- [02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=145s) design principles by trial and error unfortunately this often leads to bad results where the quality of Publications is affected for example students may use lowquality pixelated images in their manuscript they may also select small unreadable fonts and inadequate color schemes as a result reviewers will not appreciate such figures they may think that uh the manuscript is unprofessional and therefore they will reject it and obviously we want to avoid such outcomes therefore the aim of these videos is to share my experience in developing high
- [03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=181s) quality figures for research papers however I must say that graphic design for scientific illustrations is a very broad topic therefore I decided to split my tutorials into several videos first in today's video I will discuss the main principles of graphic design for figures I will show you multiple good and bad examples that I have found in the literature plus I will share examples from my own papers and show you my own failures then in the next videos I will show you the process of developing high quality figures for papers we will see
- [03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=216s) how this can be done both using programming languages and special Graphics software now these are the principles that we are going to discuss today we will start with the overall quality of figures and we'll specifically focus on the use of vector-based images the next topic is readability which means the size of your figure the size of different elements within your figure and the font size then the related topic is simplification and decluttering of complex figures the next major topic is the use of colors it is a very tricky and
- [04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=251s) complex uh subject but in short there exist bad combinations of colors and harmonious colors then we will talk about message and story of your figure your strategy this is a less technical topic but a more artistic one where you have to develop your story first and then use your data strategically to support your story the remaining topics are keeping a consistent style ideally one style per paper uh we will also discuss figures to avoid like uh pie charts and 3D and then finally we will discuss time management and time
- [04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=286s) constraints in developing high quality figures for research papers so let's begin first let's discuss why we need high quality figures for papers which figures can be considered of good quality and which figures are unacceptable actually sometimes it is very difficult to draw a line here let me tell you a story of how I realized that the quality of figures is critical for papers you see when I was a PhD student I didn't know anything about graphic design for scientific illustrations and I didn't care about
- [05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=320s) quality of figures I was just coding a lot and writing my papers and for some time everything was fine my professors and supervisors they were happy and they didn't complain about the quality of my figures but then I started receiving negative comments from some reviewers and journals some comments were saying something like the quality of figures is unacceptably low please redo them and some of my papers got rejected frankly I was a bit shocked and angry at reviewers I mean I developed my model and I wrote
- [05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=352s) a paper why did they complain about the quality of figures I even thought that they were using such comments as an excuse to reject my manuscripts finally after many negative comments I realized that my Figures were not great indeed I realized that Ruster or sometimes called Beat Map images can lose their quality they can get compressed and they can display incorrectly in the manuscripts and this is a very tricky thing that no one explained to me even nowadays I see that students don't know about this problem and they use roster images in
- [06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=386s) their manuscripts I mean uh images like gpeg or PNG formats the point is that a figure can look nice in your document in your editor I mean on your PC but once you save your paper and send it to a journal your figures can get compressed they may lose quality and this means that reviewers and editors will see them in a completely different way better than talking about this problem let me show you what happened with one of my manuscripts uh which I submitted to quite a famous engineering conference in 2019 the conference called Power Tech
- [07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=423s) here is my word editor with this manuscript submitted to the conference you can see that I used the official template of the conference you can see the title of the paper my name everything looks professional if we go to the second page we can see that this is the first figure that I use in the paper and to me it looks nice I don't see any problems with it from distance so let's zoom in when we zoom in I would say that the figure is still good quality I don't see any problems with it the colors are nice
- [07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=456s) and there are no pixels so if we zoom in even further we will see no pixels for example look at these numbers they look simply great that's why I was happy with this picture that's why I included it in the manuscript and then the manuscript was accepted now this is the same paper downloaded from the conference website so this is the final version that is published and available online you can see that this is the same template the title everything looks exactly the same however when we go to the second page to
- [08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=489s) the first figure you may notice that something is wrong with the figure the first thing I notice is that the colors faded they don't look nice anymore and something is wrong with the quality so let's zoom in and check it and when we zoom in we really see the problem of the new figure you remember we considered this number 500 now it's very ugly everything is in pixels so the quality of this figure decreased significantly this happened because the conference system compressed all images in my manuscript to reduce the size of
- [08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=526s) the paper unfortunately now all images in the manuscript look ugly the the quality is not great but I cannot change it anymore this was an eye openening experience for me I prepared beautiful figures I publish them in this conference but then my final figures in the final version of the manuscript look ugly and I cannot change this I even complained to the conference but they told me that that it's against their rules to change manuscript published in the past so basically think about this my paper will remain like this forever
- [09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=559s) and you might think that this was my mistake to use Ruster uh images in the manuscript but I I see figures like this every day I see many examples where where lowquality images appear in conference and journal Publications and I believe that this happens because many authors especially students don't know about this problem and they keep using bitmap images in their manuscripts now what to do to avoid such problems we need to use vector-based figures in vector graphics figures are defined by various formulas and shapes
- [09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=596s) therefore when you say your figure in a vector-based format let's say p PDF the figure will look exactly the same on different computers and devices and moreover it will not lose its quality and readers will be able to zoom in and explore various parts of your figures without seeing any pixels and this is why vector graphics become the best practice for many scientific illustrations let me show you a few examples of vector graphics that I used in my recent manuscripts and you will see that when using such uh vector-based
- [10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=629s) images we can put them directly in the manuscript and no quality will be lost and no pixels will appear this is the first figure that I want to show you it is saved as a PDF file if we zoom in we can see that everything in this figure is defined by shapes and objects for example we have text here and we have different uh shapes and curves therefore readers can zoom in and they will never see any pixels and here is the manuscript where I used this figure when we go to this illustration we see multiple figures
- [11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=672s) together and the first figure figure a is this PDF file that I just showed you but since I saved the figure in this Vector based format and then I saved the whole manuscript in PDF everything remains vector-based and scalable so let's zoom in and D double check that this is the same figure it has objects curves and it is scalable there are no pixels note that vector graphics can be used to display anything not only your data set or results for example in this manuscript I was working with the UK power system and I visualized it as a
- [11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=712s) graph so you can see that this is a graph but everything is again saved in PDF everything is Vector based and therefore we can zoom in and we can select different objects and there are no pixels then I included this scheme in the manuscript and again since I used uh vector-based images everything remains scalable with no loss of quality I hope you can now see the benefits of using vector graphics for research papers therefore please always try to use vector-based images and avoid using uh Ruster images like PNG files or
- [12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=752s) taking some screenshots from your software before jumping to the next topic I want to briefly mention that there exist two problems with vector graphics first of all even if you develop a nice and scalable uh image for a paper in a vector format it still can be corrupted and compressed by journal for example some journals can convert all your images into a Ruster format like PNG and then the quality will drop and uh in such cases you will need to check the final pre-print the final proof reading document and you will need
- [13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=784s) to complain to the journal that they corrupted your file so please always double check your vector images before the final publication and second point is that it is sometimes impossible to use vector graphics for certain illustrations for example if you want to show a photo of something or if you want to display a massive large data set and here I want to show you an example from my recent Publications where I couldn't use vector graphics here is the manuscript published in 2024 and in the simulation section I
- [13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=820s) have very complex simulations where I was presenting thousands and thousands of uh data points so here they are presented as a blue map actually this map consists of 15,000 points so imagine if I present these points as colored blocks or some other elements then the PDF file will be too large it will be lagging and journal will not accept it therefore what I did here is that I converted these objects into a roster image so if we zoom in we can actually see pixels however note that the overall figure is not a Ruster image it is a
- [14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=861s) vector-based image again we can see that it has objects and it is scalable so sometimes when you have complex data to visualize you will need to use such tricks to make a combination of vector graphics and restor graphics for example when you have as I said too many points to display and you can't do it using only vector-based graphics now we come to the second principle readability the point here is very simple your figures must be readable in the paper this means that readers should not zoom in like 200 300% to analyze
- [14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=897s) your data following this rule you should not use small fonts in your figures specifically you should not use fonts that are smaller than the smallest fonts in the journal template let's say that in your template the smallest font is eight points this means that when you're are developing your figure you should not use fonts smaller than eight points let me show you an example from my recent paper of how you can check this this is the same figure that we have just analyzed and at the beginning of the manuscript
- [15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=929s) I was explaining the concept and used this figure so let's see if it is readable or not the first thing I like to check is I would like to check the font size of this figure description and the font size within the figure you can check this very easily uh for example by comparing the fonts with this cursor so you can see my cursor and now it is approximately equal to this F letter then we can move my csor here to some text within the figure and we can see that the text is also almost equal to the cursor this means that these two
- [16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=972s) fonts in the figure description and within the figure are close to each other and this means that the text in the figure is readable the second thing you can do is just simply to look at your figures from distance so let's say here is 10% scale I can read the description of this figure and I also can read these titles therefore we can conclude that the text in this figure is readable and the readability principle is not violated now I want to show you a few examples from the literature where this design principle was violated I mean
- [16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1012s) unacceptably small fonts were used in the figures so let's jump to these examples here is the first example a paper published in i e access journal in 2024 and at the beginning of the paper the authors explain their framework how they use these Monte Carlo simulations let's try to understand if this figure is readable or not the first thing I see is that from distance it is really difficult for me to read it I cannot really see what is happening here so we need to zoom in let's zoom in let's say
- [17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1047s) 150% so can we read this figure or not I would say that I can read these uh titles the text here like historical data earthquake data and so on but I cannot really read what is happening in this part of the figure and in these subfigures it's really really small therefore let's zoom in even further so now we are almost 300% zoom in and now I can see what the subfigures mean and I can see that it says distance here magnitude damage and now I can understand all these subfigures but think about this to analyze the figure I
- [18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1087s) had to zoom in like three times just to see some details and read the text but this is not uh the end of the story because there is one more figure showing a map and I cannot see what this map shows so let's zoom in even further and now we can see that this is actually a map with some cities uh Los Angeles and I can see the names of the cities but actually the the font size was unacceptably small because from this distance it is impossible to see the titles and we can see that the readability principle was violated
- [18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1121s) because the authors used very very small fonts now we come to the second example so again we are looking now with no zooming in and I see the colors but I can't really see what is happening inside this figure there are some very very small elements I cannot see them let's try to zoom in so the authors are trying to show capacities of generators at different parts of a power system and only when we zoom in let's say 300% I can see that something is hidden here that something is inside behind this heat map but still
- [19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1162s) it is super small so let's zoom in even further now I have zoom in 1,200% % and only now I can see that actually yes this is the system I can see that we have some generators numbers of substations but I mean how can how can readers Analyze This figure from distance when they're reading paper like this it's simply impossible the only good thing is that the authors here used vector graphics that's why this is another example of why vector graphics should be used we can zoom in and we can see uh some details but it shouldn't be
- [19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1198s) like that allig should be readable without significant zooming in the next important principle is decluttering and simplifying complex figures in some sense this principle is related to the principle of readability if you have an overly complex figure you have too many elements readers get confused and they will not put extra effort to understand your paper and your figures so imagine this you developed a beautiful figure using vector graphics uh you use read readable fonts maybe nice colors but you still lose your readers because they
- [20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1235s) cannot understand your complex diagrams I know this feeling when you develop a framework for a paper and you have like 10 Concepts you put them all together you draw arrows between them and you like your figure but then you show it to your friend or colleague and they say oh sorry I'm lost I don't like it I don't understand what is going on and this is because you made your figure your diagram overly complex and and we have to uh simplify it and we have to declutter it so what to do you have to iteratively think about your figure in
- [21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1268s) terms of what can be removed and what can be simplified you should always ask yourself questions like is this element of the figure necessary can I simplify it can I remove it maybe I can make the figure more simple now and all these explanations I bring to the next section or to appendix try to get feedback from your colleagues and your friends and if they say that the figure is indeed too complex think about simplifying it always be cautious about your readers your figures and diagrams are clear to you because you develop them but readers
- [21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1303s) sometimes may be lost so to develop really professional and beautiful figures you should always think about readers now let's see some examples from the literature let's consider some overly complex and cluttered figures and discuss what to do with them here is an example of an overly complex and cluttered diagram this is a journal paper published in 2024 and at the beginning of the paper the authors explained their approach as this framework and uh again from the distance I can see that it is super complex it has small fonts and too many
- [22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1341s) elements let's try to zoom in and analyze what is happening here when we zoom in we see that there are actually so many blocks here if you think about this there are like three blocks on the left there are many arrows between them then uh on the right we also have many blocks and Within These blocks we have uh something else so the number of elements is simply too much for this figure and we can keep zooming in and we can see more and more pictures and elements and this means such a framework overly complex readers might get lost I
- [22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1376s) mean it is difficult for readers to analyze this figure because we don't know where to start from there is no certain hierarchy here should we analyze it from this left bottom part or from this left uh upper part so many elements so definitely this figure needs some simplification so if giving an advice I would say that we need to remove many elements and focus only on the important elements maybe we can keep only like four or five blocks four or five uh infographics this images uh maybe add some numbers like 1 2 3 4 5 to guide
- [23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1412s) readers and explain them where to focus their attention I hope you see from this example that you should never show all elements of your research in one picture you should first try to simplify it declutter it and build certain hierarchy of information and elements for example in this manuscript when presenting my Approach I developed a very very simple diagram let me show you here this is my framework I know that I have many equations and uh complex models but I wanted to make my message very simple for readers and that's why I
- [24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1451s) used only four blocks the first block I called input here I briefly discuss all data and models that I use then the second uh framework is called modeling and output so the logic is clear here we move from left to right in the center of this framework we have this modeling part and here I decided to use a little bit of Graphics so instead of just saying flexibility aggregation I wanted to show this gray area and then we add additional constraints and in the output we see the impact of constraints I wanted to show here with the red color
- [24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1486s) that the areas reduce when I developed this diagram I showed it to my colleagues and friends and I ask their opinion if this is clear what is happening in the framework and all of them confirmed that it is clear for them that the impact of constraints is here that this area becomes smaller that's why I was happy with this illustration and I proceeded with it and included in the manuscript so first of all I developed a very minimalistic uh diagram and second I asked for feedback and I confirmed that the message is
- [25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1519s) clear I know that sometimes it is impossible to show your framework your approach just in a few lines just in a few blocks you need to mention many more elements so in this case you can develop more complex Frameworks but still you need to make them minimalistic and you need to show some hierarchy between the elements so this is example from another paper where I developed a framework diagram like this you can see that there are multiple components many models used but still I try to use these areas in a light gray or dark gray and I show that
- [25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1555s) this is the problem formulation this is the analysis of our results and this is the output so we can see the hierarchy of elements within this approach in the middle uh in this cisal analysis I even have some Loops so I say for Calis we solve then for this we do it in the loop so you can explain very complex Concepts in your framework uh but it should be as I said minimalistic and there should be a very clear hierarchy if uh using arrows is not enough sometimes you can add numbers say that this is number one
- [26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1590s) this is number two and then in the text you can explain that first we do number one and then we jump to number two so I hope that you understand from these examples how you can simplify and declutter diagrams these were examples of decluttering and simplification for diagrams and Frameworks when you want to visualize your approach or certain system however the same problem happens when we want to visualize data or results of our simulations let me show you a few more examples here you can see another example from a journal paper published
- [27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1626s) in 2024 where authors presented their simulations using four subfigures in each subfigure using double AIS so the results look very complex because there are too many elements and the figure definitely needs some simplification think about this there are multiple bar charts in each figure plus there are Lines line plots and more than 10 colors used in figures all of these elements make it difficult for readers to analyze the results and draw some conclusions if improving this figure we would need to identify the
- [27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1662s) main message and probably remove some of these data uh displayed to make it simpler for readers to analyze it actually later in this paper there is another figure I wanted to show you here at the end the authors show the results of a clustering algorithm and this type of a figure is called spaghetti plot in graphic design this is a funny name but what it means is that you have so many lines that together they look like a spaghetti which basically means that they're meaningless to readers there are simply too many of lines too many of
- [28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1699s) data points I would also recommend you avoid using such spaghetti plots and instead show only the most important parts of your data we will see how to do this in a moment all right so we just saw examples of complex and cluttered images uh when presenting data let's see some good examples um this time I don't want to show examples from my papers instead I found a very professional and popular paper from open AI team about their training of gpt3 language model when I'm making this video now the paper is cited
- [28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1735s) 31,000 times it is also included in the list of the most influential ml papers so let's see how a top machine learning paper looks like here is this paper called language models a few short Learners let's now check how they used Graphics to display their results because obviously they're working with very large and very complex models specifically I want to show you this figure note that the authors have many many simulations so they had something like a plot but instead of showing all of these lines they put them in the
- [29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1773s) background they made them transparent and they showed only a few important lines in these orange green and blue colors I believe this is a great example of how data can be simplified you don't show all data all lines that you have instead you highlight only the most important parts of your data and you show your message actually this manuscript has many uh nice illustrations and we can learn from them I just want to show you one more figure uh let's go to the next page here this is the figure showing performance of the model and we can see
- [30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1817s) that the authors also have many curves to show but I would argue that this figure is not cluttered it is not super complex because the authors tried to present it in a simple way they are using this nice uh color scheme here on the right and therefore it is easy for us to analyze all lines presented here and we can easily see that this yellow model for example it has lower losses and better accuracy so another great example of how you should present very complex data but in a decluttered and simple way the next principle that I want to
- [30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1855s) discuss today is the use of colors there is the whole theory about colors it is a fascinating Topic at the intersection of Art and Science and I encourage you to read about it if you have time however in this video I won't explain color theory and instead I will just show you some tools and we'll cover a few practical aspects of how to use colors in creating beautiful figures the main practical question that you might have is which colors to use and which not to use the first thing thing that I want to
- [31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1889s) tell you about colors is that sometimes you don't need to use any colors at all in fact there is a rule that sometimes no colors is better than many colors think about this when you are developing a figure you already have three colors at your disposal white black and gray plus you can use solid lines and dashed lines which means that you can visualize quite a lot of data without using any colors if you want you can add one maybe maximum two colors to these uh black white and gray but you should not use
- [32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1923s) all rainbow colors to visualize your data I also saw another similar rule saying that you should design without color first so design in black and white and this will help you to First focus on your layout uh the view of your figure and your message and then you can start adding colors let me show you a few examples from the literature about this no color rule here is quite a popular paper about wind generation forecast published in 2007 and the authors didn't want to use many colors you can see that they're using only black lines or Dash
- [32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1961s) lines but at some point they present quite complex results here this is example of a probabilistic forecast so we can see with a black line prediction then with these line measurements and then many prediction intervals with shades of gray I wanted to show you this picture because it shows that really complex data like this probabilistic forecast can be displayed without any colors just black white and Shades of Gray if you want to you can add a few colors maybe you can make this line green the forecast but you don't really
- [33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=1996s) have to use all rainbow colors to show these data another example is from my paper where I was visualizing uh the concept of flexibility I was showing how these two sets let add together so we have one set then second set and there is summation and I could have used many colors but I decided not to do this I'm showing everything in gray black or dashed and I just added one blue color for these arrows to make it a little bit more entertaining for readers so they can easily notice that we have a direction here this is another example
- [33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2031s) of using no colors or just one color in figures of course if you want to you can use many colors in your figures but here you need to keep in mind these two points the first point is that you need to be cautious about using bright colors bright colors don't look great together and they don't look great in uh scientific papers let's say bright green bright yellow or bright red the second point is that you should be cautious about using complimentary colors complimentary colors are two colors that
- [34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2066s) sit uh that are the opposite to each other so they sit on the opposite sides of a color wheel and this means that they cancel each other if mixed here I want to show you uh an example from Wikipedia about complimentary colors and I like this page because it shows these really cool examples of why we should not use complimentary colors actually it hurts me to look at these colors they are so contrast imagine if you use them in a manuscript if you show one data in this San and then in red it all looks very difficult
- [35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2100s) to analyze and it's simply not great for reviewers eyes so please uh try not to use bright complimentary colors and especially don't use many of them in one figure instead you want to use analogous colors in your figures such colors sit close to each other on the color wheel and usually the color palettes that they create they are pleasing to the eye let me show you a few examples and I want to show you some tools that you can use to analyze color schemes the first tool I want to show you is the Adobe color
- [35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2135s) wheel when you open this website you see the color wheel and here on the left you see the harmony now it's analogous as I said this means that all colors are quite close to each other and they create an analogous uh palette so this is the pet that we see now we can also change the colors if we want we can create uh blue palette blue green palette and so on and then we can save uh our results we can save these colors and use them in our figures if we like them and as I said this was an analogous color scheme here we can select
- [36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2172s) complimentary colors and you can see that these colors they are exactly the opposite to each other on the color wheel which means that this uh orange color is complimentary to this Canan color and this is what we should avoid in our figures so don't use bright red with bright green don't use bright yellow with this purple or blue color because this will not look great together on white background in your figure so I highly recommend you to play with this tool you can analyze shades of the colors you can see various other
- [36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2210s) harmonies like split complimentary Triad and so on so many many pallets that you can create using this tool or see if these colors work together or not however you don't have to always develop your color combinations using the color wheel you can simply select some existing color pallets and here I would recommend to you this website colorex thatcombines some of them are not great for papers they are great for other design purposes but anyway you you can select a color scheme you like and use it in your figures let's say you like this
- [37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2253s) beautiful blue color palette if you click on it you can see information about all colors in this palette let's say that in Python uh maybe you need these RGB components to create a color so here are your components please use them you can also see some related color palettes uh even comments by other users and if you click on on a color you can see even more information about this color various shades of this color tints some related palettes other similar colors and so on and so forth so this is a great tool to select a color palette
- [38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2287s) you like for a certain task these were examples of creating new color harmonies or selecting some existing ones from the internet but in reality when you are coding and developing a figure you don't need to select some new color harmonies you just go to your software to your programming language and select some existing color Petes and uh your task is basically just to select an adequate color palette for visualizing your data or your results for example I code in Julia and Julia has this nice package called color schemes and there are many
- [38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2323s) color combinations and color gradients already built in in this package let me show you how this looks like there are so many colors in this package you can see this is the standard palette uh I like some of these colors but I think that um green and um red might not be working well together but some of these colors are okay if you don't like the standard colors you can see many other gradients you can see gradients from Orange to Blue and so on here is another gradient from light blue to dark blue I think this is a great one the only
- [39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2357s) gradient I don't like is this rainbow because it has basically all colors together and if you visualize your data using all possible colors including compliment colors um the visualization will not look nice so please be very cautious about using uh color schemes like rainbow and uh just to show you there are so many gradients from many other packages including uh mats laab I believe there are hundreds and hundreds of various gradients feel free to select any you like for visualizing your data one more thing that I want to tell you
- [39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2393s) about colors is that colors can be used strategically the point is that there exists uh color psychology and certain readers may have certain biases about colors certain ways of understanding your colors for example a common way of understanding red color is that it means something incorrect something bad the green color usually means that uh it is the best solution something correct or something improving so if you're using red and green colors in your figure please think about why you doing this and if the answer is that you are just
- [40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2429s) displaying your data maybe you should not use these colors because readers might be confused and they might understand your data in some other ways some incorrect ways and please don't use yellow color there are many articles on the internet about the problems with yellow color in short it looks bad on white background of papers uh it is difficult for readers to analyze your data displayed in yellow now let's see some examples from the literature that that I found for this tutorial here is a recently published paper about uh
- [41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2462s) machine learning for power flow in Distribution Systems it is a very complex and interesting paper with many equations and illustrations and here on page six I noticed something strange about the way how the authors display the results and when I analyzed what is happening here I noticed that they're using yellow color and you can see that it is difficult to find this yellow line and to to to analyze it and as I said this happens because yellow color is getting easily lost on the white background below we can see more
- [41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2497s) examples of Curves and we can see that not only the authors used the yellow color they used many complimentary colors like these green cyan purple and so on and altogether these colors don't look great then on the next page the authors present their results uh about some Jacobian error matric and they have for sub figures showing the heat map the problem is that the color scheme is Rainbow so the values have all possible colors and I tried analyzing this data it is very difficult for me to understand what this means simply
- [42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2530s) because there are so many colors displayed so I think this is a great example of showing why uh using too many colors like rainbow color scheme can be confusing to readers and uh it can be not a great choice for visualizing your data set here is another example of a strange choice of colors in a bar chart diagram in this study the authors show the reasons of major blackouts from extreme events and we can see that there are many different categories of data through years the problem is that there are so many categories and so many
- [42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2565s) colors and also it resembles somehow a rainbow color scheme so we see red colors blue colors uh green colors it is difficult to navigate here and understand what data looking at and moreover uh talking about the psychology of colors one of the reasons here is the wild fire so readers might think that if we are talking about fire these data should be in red but actually all these data in red has nothing to do with wildfires and the fire the fire category is in this yellow green which can be simply confusing to some readers instead
- [43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2604s) what you want to do in your figures is to select your your colors strategically so if you have a message that something is declining uh or something is bad maybe you want to use a white uh red gradient and you can show that when it's becoming uh worse um you have more and more red color maybe dark red color let me show you a few examples from my papers in this manuscript in the results section I had simulations showing the problems with nonlinearity in Power Systems and I argu that this nonlinearity is dangerous so what I did
- [44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2641s) I selected gray red color scheme where this light gray or light red means good and dark red means bad and the message here is pretty simple that when we have these red areas this means that we have no linearity and this is a dangerous area in contrast we can say that this area on the left is good and I showed this figure to some colleagues and they said that yes they easily understand the message of the figure because I used a very simple and intuitive color scheme from Gray to Red I did the same thing in these
- [44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2677s) figures I'm showing these areas and I'm saying that they are decreasing because we have additional limits so I say that here are the limits and once we impose more and more limits the color changes from Blue to red and again the message seems to be intuitive that the area decreases and therefore the color becomes red so the simple color uh scheme that I selected for this figure is blue to Red the next principle is the message and story of your figures your strategy the point here is that you should never simply show all data that
- [45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2712s) you have you should think first about the story and message that you have behind your figure and then you need to show only the part of data that supports your message and you need to use text colors uh strategically to highlight this message so you need to help readers and guide them throughout your story as we just discussed with the colar examples the color can be used strategically you can show that you are moving from white to Red which is bad and you need to help readers to understand this so first you can use
- [45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2744s) colors you can also put special titles saying that look there is a problem here error whatever and you can also use the description of your figure so don't simply say in your figure description that this this is figure number five analysis of results say that this is analysis of results on the left we see good case on the right we see bad case something is reducing which is displayed which is highlighted by the red color so by reading this your audience already can understand what to expect that something was good something became bad
- [46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2778s) that's why the colors change and everything all elements of your figure should work together to support your story and message uh that you want to say so always keep in mind the message that you want to deliver by a figure and never simply show all data that you have speaking about delivering a message of your figure and your strategy I want to mention a very interesting principle that many people analyze figures in Z shapes let me show you what I mean by that this is the red blue figure that we just considered so by the Z shapes I
- [46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2813s) mean that readers usually start analyzing figure from these top left corner and then they move through the figure in this Z shape sometimes they make uh multiple zigzags while reading your data for example first they can read the description here then they can go to the center iterating the center and then go and make one more Loop read what are the axes not all readers do this sometimes they just start analyzing your figure from the center but still there exists this tendency that readers start analyzing from the top left corner and
- [47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2850s) then they move in these shapes why I'm showing this example to you is because I was strategic in developing this figure and that's why I put all description in the top the first thing that readers see is the explanation of the areas that are displayed and they can see these explanations and then they can move to the center of the figure and see that indeed this is what they're looking at another thing is that I used the figure description a lot I explained what we are seeing here I see that the cross
- [48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2883s) marker means this then we see some colors we see that areas are reducing so everything is explained in one place which I believe makes it easy for readers to analyze this picture now let's come back to this example of the Jacobian matrix error here I want to show you how readers can be confused when uh seeing a lot of data without certain strategic guidance so imagine the readers start here so they don't see the axis and they don't see any additional labels so basically they have no information what they're looking
- [48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2919s) at so they start exploring this figure in Z shapes maybe they see this uh color bar uh so they see that there are different colors and different values uh displayed in the figure but again there is no name of this color bar so the readers may be a bit lost about what they're look looking at so let's say that readers spend some time here analyzing this figure they are lost there are so many colors and so many data points so then they jump to the next subfig and the same story repeats here there is no uh label of this axis
- [49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2951s) No Label of this color bar the data is very complex so the readers may think okay I don't understand what is happening let's uh let's jump to this figure the same story repeats here the only difference is that we see different colors this uh figure has more yellow color than other figures and my point is that readers may be jumping between these four subfigures but they may be lost because there is not enough information not enough clues for them to really understand what is going on the only thing that we see in
- [49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=2983s) the description of the subfigures is that this is jacoban Matrix error error error and the same thing is said in the description of the figure so if improving this figure I would recommend adding additional guidance adding more information in the names of each subfigure adding description of the axis and maybe adding even more text here and there just to draw readers attention saying look here uh this is the problem this is changing this is important this is not important overall I would say that this figure lacks guidance and some
- [50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3019s) strategic use of color layout and figure description let me show you another example where actually the colors and the layout of the figure were used really strategically and really helping readers to understand what is going on this figure is not from my field it's not from electrical engineering but the point is look how this figure is designed we start analyzing the figure from the left top corner and the first thing we see is this color bar which explains us the whole Narrative of the picture we see that the red color means
- [50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3056s) maximum positive contribution we see that there is white no contribution and negative contribution so this is the first thing that we look at and already we understand kind of the story of the figure and then we see on the right results of the simulations and the results are pretty intuitive because we see which compounds which parts of these uh molecules are more important and bringing more contributions so as I said this is not my field but I like how the authors used the colors and layout strategically and even the Z shape reading rule was
- [51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3091s) respected the next principle is using consistent style in figures in your paper I think it's very simple principle basically it says use one style per paper don't change your colors or elements of your figures too often from figure to figure even though this is very simple principle uh I still find some uh strange examples in the literature and I just want to show you a few things to avoid and be cautious about so let me show you this example by showing you this figure I want to highlight the problem of
- [52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3125s) inconsistent use of arrows and various shapes in this specific figure there are too many types of arrows and lines used so let's say that this uh black line black solid line shows the interconnection between different elements in a distribution system however then we have these uh dashed lines I'm not sure what they're showing probably internet connection data connection to the cloud and on the top of that we have the third type of Arrow this kind of 3D uh bent Blue Arrow showing something different so try to
- [52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3161s) avoid using too many types of arrows in one figure because this may be confusing for readers and uh try to avoid using too many types of lines like black line dashed line dashed orange line and so on I also found this paper about energy storage and hydrogen in Malaysia the paper is interesting however what I noticed is that many figures have inconsistent different styles in total there are almost 20 figures in the paper and all of them have different styles so if you look at figure number one it has a blue orange bar charts then we have a
- [53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3200s) gray figure then we have figures like this with red arrows then we have figures with black arrows and so many types of arrows and so many types of diagrams just in one publication please try to use one style if you are developing your figures in Python and you are using uh red and purple colors please do this in most of your figures in a manuscript I mean it happens in many Publications where you see figures from python figures from Excel some other software the problem is that such papers look like a report uh
- [53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3236s) not like a single paper but as a collection of different figures from different reports and reviewers and readers might not like it the next point that I want to discuss is some figures to avoid or to be cautious about specifically pie charts and 3D figures let's start with pie charts many people think that pie charts are widely accepted tool it's a basic tool used everywhere and it's great to use them in papers however some designers uh and scientists argue that pie charts are not great for readers and that using pie
- [54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3272s) charts should be avoided the problem is that you are asking your readers to perform a very difficult uh geometric task you asking them to compare uh to compute angles in this pie chart these sectors and then to compare areas of the sectors which is really as I said difficult geometric task and actually in this book storytelling with data the author also mentions problems with pie charts and I want to show you some examples from the website of this book storytelling with data here is the article about using pie charts in the
- [55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3308s) storytelling with data website and it explains why there are certain problems with pie charts for example here let me ask you which is larger C or D I can't really tell it's very difficult again to compare these areas of the sectors uh how can we see how can we show which is larger probably we will need to put some numbers close to CN D but in that case your readers will be reading numbers and not looking at the pie chart instead if you show your pie chart as bar chart it is very easy to see that c is actually larger
- [55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3345s) than D I believe this is a great example showing how pie chart make our life hard in analyzing data and then uh if you read this article there are many other problems with pie charts discussed how it's difficult to compare various slices and so on this is a great example showing why 3D plus pie charts is a very complex task because the information gets distorted even more like here this slice with 22% looks larger than with 25% simply because in 3D it is located closer to us so please don't use pie charts and don't use 3D pie charts
- [56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3384s) because it's really difficult to analyze them here I found an example for you of a journal paper it's a review paper where the authors discuss uh various Publications uh per year and they present data as four pie charts and we see the same problem that it is very difficult to analyze pie charts imagine I want to analyze this purple um slice this is what happened in 2022 sorry in in this pie chart but then what happens in the next pie chart so I need to go from one pie chart to another just simply to compare one slice it
- [57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3420s) takes a lot of time a lot of energy and that's why it is usually advised to avoid using pie charts in presenting your data in research papers regarding 3D figures I myself liked 3D figures a lot I uh wanted to use them a lot in my papers I thought that they look fancy they look complex and if I use a lot of 3D in my papers uh it will make them unusual however the truth is that in 90% of cases 3D is not a great solution to display your data uh in your papers and the only thing it does it confuses readers Let Me Show an
- [57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3459s) example from a paper in this paper authors analyzed voltages in a distribution Network and they decided to present voltage profiles in a 3D space so we can see there are three dimensions time uh bus which means sub station and uh voltage the problem is however that it is very difficult to analyze such 3D surfaces such 3D figures there are many data points which are overlapping and I cannot zoom in and see the solutions that are located behind so please try to avoid using 3D if you are not absolutely sure that it is necessary
- [58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3496s) to visualize your Solutions the last point that I want to mention today is time look I have many years of experience in developing uh figures for papers and coding them and even I cannot create a beautiful figure in one day I mean in few hours it will take me at least few days to develop nice figures so the first day I develop draft the main idea and then the next day I come back to the figure and I see what can be improved and maybe the next day I show U the figure to my colleagues I get some feedback and only after a few
- [58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3532s) iterations I can finally create beautiful and professional figure so don't expect to create beautiful figures for your research papers fast be patient and uh try to enjoy the process actually I believe that creating beautiful figures is a very satisfying task you are creating something beautiful and useful from scratch and people will be reading these results later on so yeah as I say be patient and just try to enjoy the process and try to develop figures in a few iterations all right that's it about the principles of
- [59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3567s) beautiful figures thank you for being with me through this long tutorial let's quickly recap what we have discussed we first talked about the overall quality of figures and discussed the problem of using vector-based images and roster images then we discussed readability of figures the size of font and various elements of your figures and the related topic of simplifying and decluttering complex figures the next uh major topic was the use of colors how to not use complimentary colors bright colors and focus on more harmonious analogous color
- [1:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3606s) schemes then we discussed the message and the story of your figures how you can use various elements in your figures strategically uh the remaining topics were keeping a consistent style one style per paper we also discussed some figures to avoid like pie charts and 3D and we discussed time management and time con rins in the next videos I will show you examples of how I create figures for my papers we will start with coding examples how we can tune plotting packages parameters and then we will move to some Advanced uh topics like
- [1:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-HAjex6VtM&t=3641s) using graphic software vector graphics software for adjusting your figures modifying them and we will come to developing quite Advanced and complex figures that you cannot simply develop in Excel or in your programming language I hope that ideas that we discussed today will be useful for you and that you will create very beautiful figures in your research papers please let me know your feedback about this tutorial and any questions that you have I will be happy to see your comments thank you and see you soon bye
