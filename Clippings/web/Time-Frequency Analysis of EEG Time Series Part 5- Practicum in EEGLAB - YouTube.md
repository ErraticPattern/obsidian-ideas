- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=0s) hello my name is arnold deloren and this is part five of a series of video on time frequency analysis of eeg time series this part is about using the easy map software package to actually perform spectral decomposition decompositions here we assume you've loaded the continuous eg lab dataset and that it contains channel locations then you would go to the plot menu and select channel spectra and map once you do that a window pops up asking for more parameters most of these parameters are self-explanatory if you
- [00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=36s) uh you can get more details about these parameters if you select the help menu on this interface or you can also look at the eg app tutorial so you simply press ok and this type of plot is the one you would obtain with each trace representing one electrodes and scalp topographies plotted at the selected frequencies so this is the power spectrum of the data using the p wash method we've talked about in part two importantly here you can change the parameter of the welsh methods such as the amount of zero padding and
- [01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=71s) the overlap of the windows by typing them in the edit box also if you look at the matlab command line which you cannot see here you can see details about the welsh method parameters on this slide we're going to plot a time frequency decomposition here we're plotting the time frequency decomposition of an ica component but you can plot time frequency decomposition of data channels as well in this case the default is set to using free cycle per wavelets at the lowest frequency and a scale expansion factor of 0.5
- [01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=106s) on the same row where you select the wavelet parameters you can instead select for your transform by checking the checkbox here we have selected to plot component 1. if you look on the matlab command line you can get more information about the number of cycles at the lowest and highest frequencies you can also get information about which frequencies are being processed in this case 23 frequencies from 5.
- [02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=132s) 9 hertz to 50 hertz this is the plot you obtain on the top you have the event related spectral perturbation or usb and on the bottom you have the inter trial coherence or itc in this component we can see blocking of 20 hertz frequency band activity after stimulus presentation and increase in five to eight hertz frequency band activity for the itc we can see broadband activity at about 100 milliseconds which is usually which usually indicates a sharp peak present in most trials so a erp peak this is because as we saw in
- [02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=172s) one of the previous presentation we need all the frequencies to model a sharp peak in the input signal then we can also have istc activations at frequencies observed in the power spectrum of at somewhat different latencies you can choose to mask for significance here at 0.01 and now that if you mask for significance i strongly advise that you correct for multiple comparison by checking the fdr checkbox in the same row this is the plot you obtain and now the pure green color indicates time frequency regions where
- [03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=209s) the spectral estimate is not significant as for the spectrum you can also change your padding this is usually only valid when using this fourier transforms but when you use wavelet the function simply increase the number of frequencies as if you were using for a transform so for this function we use what we call the pad ratio parameter which simply multiplies the number of frequencies so in the previous slide we had 23 frequencies so if we have a pad ratio of two we have twice the number of frequencies in this
- [04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=244s) case 46 instead of 23. this is how the plot looks like for a pad ratio of one and a pad ratio of two and you can see how the time frequency image is smoother on the right compared to the left this is now just plotting the intercharge coherence or itc when plotting itc there are additional options that allow you for example to plot the phase of the itc in addition to its amplitude so when you use the plot phase options you are now able to see the phase of the itc you may look at presentation number four in this series
- [04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=282s) for what i mean in terms of phase and amplitude of the itc finally it's also possible to use custom frequencies for example here i selected frequency one two three four five six hertz and the same number four cycles and this is arbitrary so i do not recommend to use this value necessarily for publication purposes i usually use log space frequencies and linear increase in the number of cycles which i cap to 8 above 45 hertz i capped the number of cycle at 8 because most articles use 8 or sometimes 12 cycles wavelet to study high gamma
- [05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=322s) band power so it would not make sense to continue to increase the number of cycle level 45 hertz if you want to use the same parameter you can simply copy and paste these two lines in your script or copy and paste the values in the edit box in the graphic interface so now let's run a simple eeg example in each lab with some of the included example data sets for the spectrum i'm going to use a continuous data set after loading it i go to channel spectra and maps and simply press ok we can see a nice peak in the alpha
- [06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=368s) frequency range at 10 hertz which is present in most subjects even when they have their eyes open and here you see the window size is 128 samples so one second which gives me a resolution of one hertz i can also increase the frequency resolution by either zero padding or increasing the size of the window here i'll use a window of size 256 hertz so i get of size 256 so i get a resolution of half a hertz and you can see how smoother it is now so now let's move to time frequency decomposition for this i'm going to import the other
- [07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=422s) example that set we which already has data epochs extracted as a reminder for both ersp and itcs we need data epochs now i go to the menu to plot time frequency decompositions i will plot the time frequency decomposition of component 1 and simply keep all the defaults to get more help you can press the help button and this provides information for each of the options of the graphic interface as you can see here so i press ok and this is the time frequency decomposition for component one we can also mask for significance
- [08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0430f_W0mo&t=487s) here at 0.05 with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparison are these few negative pixel real changes we can increase the threshold for significance to 0.01 and also increase the number of frequencies so it takes a little longer to compute because of the higher resolution and higher threshold for significance but you can see that these negative blobs are still present so this is the end of this presentation this was the last part of this series and i want to thank you for your attention
