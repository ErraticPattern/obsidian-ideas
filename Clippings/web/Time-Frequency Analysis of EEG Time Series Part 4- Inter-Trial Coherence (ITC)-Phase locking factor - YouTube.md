- [00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=1s) hello my name is arnold delorme and this is part four of a series a video on time frequency analysis of eeg time series this part is about intel trial coherence which is also called phase locking factor this is a relatively short video here are three trials one in red one in blue and one in grid with different phase alignments on the left the face is different and the peaks do not align on the right the phase is similar and the peak aligned this is reflected in the erp averages on the left the erp is almost flat while
- [00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=36s) on the right we observe several peaks it's important to note that the spectral power is identical or almost identical because spectral power simply looks at the average oscillation amplitude this amplitude is independent of the phase of the signal in single trials since power cannot provide us with information about the synchronization of the trials what can we do well we can complete compute what we call inter trial coherence this measure was pioneered by tanon badri and collaborators in 1996 although they used a different name the
- [01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=71s) phase locking factor then scott mckeig coined the term inter-trial coherence a few years later this is a signal in red and the corresponding phasor at the dominant frequency of the signal the orientation of the vector depends on the phase of the signal at time t and the length depends on the amplitude of the signal now let's have a look at another trial the green trial has a larger amplitude compared to the raid and the phase is shifted by 90 degree the third purple trial has a smaller amplitude compared to the red and is
- [01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=108s) shifted by a 180 degrees computing spectral power consisting taking the average of the square of the vector length or vector amplitude and we've done that before now what is new here is that we can also ignore the amplitude information and simply average three vectors of length one so average the normalized phase vectors this is what's done here this is the average vector in white and its length or magnitude tells us whether the different trials have the same phase and its orientation indicates the dominant
- [02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=145s) phase now let's go back to our first example you can see that in the first case on the left the phase of the single trials are not aligned in this case the phase of the vector will be random and the average of the normalized phase vector will have a small magnitude or length in this case the length is 0.
- [02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=168s) 05 with one being the maximum length now on on on the right this is different now the phase are relatively aligned and the length of the average phase vector is 0.8 or 80 percent this is the value of the inter trial it's an indicator of faint synchronization between trials since trial onset usually depends on the presentation of a stimulus this is a measure indicating how stimulus leads to phase resynchronization in the eeg i'm going to provide an example here this is the standard event related potential or erp model in this model the
- [03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=208s) eeg single trial is equal to the average plus some background noise this means that the itc should always be close to one with perfect synchronization of the phase in single trials it also means that the background eeg noise is not affected by the presentation of the stimulus here is a famous example showing that that's not the case this is the eeg alpha ringing phenomenon that sometimes occur for non-target trials in visual task this is the earp image with trials sorted with increasing face this erp image only contains trials with
- [04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=244s) high alpha power and this is the earp image with the lowest alpha power the trials with the lowest alpha power where we see that there is almost no signal even after the stimulus presentation now this is the erp and the inter trial coherence for these two sets of trials we can see that the erp shows oscillation for the data trials with high alpha but not for the data trials with low alpha and this is also reflected in the inter trial coherence here inter trial coherence is computed over time windows in the alpha frequency band so we can
- [04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=281s) see its variation through time the intertroy coherence is much larger for trials with high alpha than for trials with low alpha reflecting more resynchronization of the underlying eg with the presentation of the stimulus what is also interesting here is the amplitude of the itc reaching at about 0.4 so much lower than one now remember that according to the true erp hypothesis itc should always be close to one in general when looking at itc the value will be relatively large for early erp peaks such as 0.8 for p1
- [05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh_ZVt-VCoY&t=318s) and then decrease as time progresses with typical value for p300 between 0.3 and 0.4 now to conclude on the itc it's a very useful measure to go beyond the simple trial average it was instrumental in showing that the true erp hypothesis was another simplification but ignore important variability in single trials the itc allows to determine how the eeg gets affected by presentation of stimuli i want to thank you for your attention and i'll see you in the next video
