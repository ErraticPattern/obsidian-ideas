## Transcript:
- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=0s) so please let me introduce Dr. [[Eleni Kroupi]] is working as neuroscience research engineer and project manager at [[Starlab]] company you can find more information about star lab on the webpage star lab dot es she received her PhD in electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lucerne. before joining STAR Labs she has worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the applied signal processing group at EPFL and in the Department of Psychology at University of Freiburg Switzerland
- [00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=35s) and her research interests include affective computing biomedical, [[Digital Signal Processing]], machine learning in biomedical and effective signals analysis of brain and peripheral electrical activity knowledge there are signal modeling and analysis so welcome Eleni and the floor is yours thank you very much for the recent election a good afternoon to everybody from my side as well so as I said the talk of today is going to be on advanced [[EEG]] processing tools and applications and I have tried to do my best to create and to do like to present you something
- [01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=76s) like a compromise between low level and high level features of this kind of processing tools and applications so that at least you get a glimpse of what you can do we leave these signals okay so let's start I really hope you enjoy their network so as you probably know typically the pipeline includes acquiring a signal with a device that you already have and then applying some offline on real-time processing tools will the final goal to create to present some outputs like to do for example let's let's say some group comparisons
- [01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=116s) or to present some like visual characteristics about the analysis you have been doing I would usually and provide services of signal analysis which most of the times we are delivered in the forms of variable that you can see here so um you probably already know you have some steps are quite required to do it properly if the analysis this include the pre-processing which mainly includes the removal of the noise so that you bring your new signals in the best possible condition so that later on you analyze you extract particular features
- [02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=153s) from them and then finally later on you may want to do some statistics or apply some classification methods in order to be able to discriminate between two groups or between two conditions etc so these are the topics I will try to cover in the talk today I have put included this picture that you can see in the right corner of the presentation because this is how I see the whole topic like you can see there that there are two people who are looking at the same thing but from different perspective so one since
- [03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=188s) this letter is a Q and the other one sees this letter as a B so for me all these methodologies that we are going to talk about today like that include bump our cross frequency capping complexity and connectivity they are actually different points of view of the same of the same thing which is the easy signal I would say that each one of them is like different information so either the way I see the whole thing is getting a whole like a bigger perspective of what is happening in the brain when you include different varieties of these
- [03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=224s) different techniques so in this talk we are mainly going to we are going to focus on the feature extraction part of the of the EEG signals once that you have already pre processed them the first thing I'm going to talk about but I will not spend much time here is I just want to remind you because I suppose I assume that everybody knows more or less what is been powering the EEG signal I just want to remind you that each bomb Power has been shown to be related with some particular functions this list is not exclusive of
- [04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=258s) course so for example the delta EG band has been related to slow-wave sleep the theta band has been to meditation and concentration the [[alpha band]] is related to real access on the better band to active busy or anxious thinking into active concentration as well and then the Lama Bank has been related to binding information from different sensory modalities we should not forget the band power analysis before going to more complete complex analysis I wanted to present you two applications that for me they have used like BAM power features
- [05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=300s) in a very nice way one of them we carried it out within the project Michael J Fox foundation project and Parkinson's disease and what we saw actually here we found is it is a increase in the power of the lower see later and also we found and a decrease of the frequency of the of the alpha band so with this is progression okay let me explain a bit better we have here you can see that we had the healthy controls balanced by FC and then we have the rapid eye movement behavior disorder which is a disorder that has to do with
- [05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=345s) some inability of inhibiting the sensory outputs during sleep that means that this pace in there actually acting out to daydreams which can be dangerous to themselves they can be dangerous to to the people who would they are sleeping with this RBD skill then later on evolved into a PD the Parkinson's disease which can then later evolved into dementia with Lewy bodies which has like can leap into mental decline the dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most commonly known disease I mentally you see the mental disease after the
- [06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=382s) Alzheimer's so this is the disordered progression and you can see from the failure here that we have we know this power increase and then we know is the slowing of the alpha band that is moving towards the as the lower frequencies and we are this will notice power decrease in this population and another application that I also wanted to mention regarding this power bands is for the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder probably you have heard of this disorder before but it has to do with children that are super but
- [07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=422s) they are hyperactive so they cannot really focus and this doesn't allow them to do to carry on to carry out normal tasks so based on the power ratio of the data to beta balance and we it was found significant differences were found between ADHD children compared to AIDS much healthy controls in a variety of studies so that finally this metric was approved by the FDA as a matrix an automatic that can help confirm and as an ADHD diagnosis also you probably know that there a lot of neurofeedback studies that based their you know feeble
- [07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=469s) activities on on the power band again this metric has been is very important because the neurofeedback based on the photo to beta ratio it was recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics to be as effective if as the medication for the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder okay now let's not spend much time in the balance in the power bands and let's see like how from move into one single power band how we can move to the cross frequency coupling between two different banks okay so the functional role of the
- [08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=510s) Cross frequency funky functioning coupling is based on two principles one is the fact that high frequencies reflect local domains of cortical processing and the other is that the low frequencies reflect cortical processing in distributed regions in trained both by external and by they're non-cognitive events so we have the low frequencies and the high frequencies one in the local domain and the other one in the distributed regions and the cross frequency capping off both of them what it does is that it transfers the information from the
- [09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=546s) distributed networks to the local networks for most effective processing there are different cross frequency coupling methods and which include for example the amplitude to up into coupling between two different oscillations I like a low frequency well was talking about the low frequency oscillator and the high frequency oscillator that for example would be theta band and government etc we also have face-to-face coupling and finally we also have faced one featured coupling which is commonly written as PAC I will
- [09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=582s) give you some examples of face to amplitude copying because it is the one that is gaining a lot of visibility nowadays in recent years so the principle of the face to engage it coupling is that the amplitude of a high frequency oscillator for example the gamma band is driven by the face of a low frequency oscillator for example the data band okay there are various ways of measuring that there are different kinds of implementations one of the implementations which has been really commonly used is implementation of tort
- [10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=618s) in 2010 who created the modulation index which is a measure of phase to amplitude capping this modulation index is based on the estimation of the envelope of the high frequency signal and the estimation of the face of the low frequency signal using the Hilbert transform and then with this two kind with the face and the amplitude of these two oscillators he creates what he calls the face amplitude plot and then he identified the distance from the unit distribution of this plot which resembles to be a distribution and
- [10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=652s) he calls this metric modulation index and he says the further the distance of this block from the year distribution the higher my modulation the high yeah the higher my modulation index and the higher the coupling between face and the amplitude of my underlined oscillators however volatile in 2015 they introduced another metric which they hold Deepak from the biasing pact because they notice that when you identify when you try to estimate the Hilbert transform like the face especially the face from the Hilbert transform as he himself says
- [11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=690s) in his original paper you need to have narrow Bank signals however most of the times this is not the case in the AG signals because they need to be like neurophysiological interpretable which for example makes it like if you want to take into account the better bond even if you break it into low beta and high beta band and again the low bit and the high better they are going to be quite broad so he identified the criteria to the bias from these values that the Hilbert transform would introduce into the estimation of
- [12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=725s) the face there are as well other implementations so if you're really interested in this topic you can encourage you to search for this but I wanted to mention last one which is actually very recent implementation it was this was published in 2019 in scientific reports and the authors present a new pac-man trick which they call time frequency based pac---- metric and this time frequency based back metric it avoids to use a Hilbert transform and it does not rely on bandpass filtering whereas it relies on a complex time frequency distribution to
- [12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=764s) estimate both the face and the envelope of the low and the high frequency oscillations with the high frequencies resolution the authors are key that is more accurate for measuring the coupling strengths myself I have not tried that yet but if you're really interested in the topic I would encourage you to to tell them to do so ok so how are this applied into the EEG signals and what kind of intuitions can we get from applying the space amplitude coupling so over the years one of the most common coupling synchronizations between the
- [13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=804s) low and high frequencies was the theta drama pack which has been shown to be related to ordering inviting of perceptual features during a calm encoding indeed there was a study very recent study in 2018 that they did an experiment with associative memory in an associative memory task experiment where they were associating object and color combinations and they found an increase in face amplitude coupling between frontal theta and from the temporal anomoly oscillations which were specific for this picture color associations and
- [14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=843s) then again this study supports the idea that they take a gamma phase amplitude capping is related to binding features during encoding another article again a very recent one this was published in 2020 they measured phase amplitude coupling with for a working memory task which was chained by tDCS so what they found is that the argument in the working memory training with tDCS elicited sustained changes in the fettered wama phase amplitude capping for which both the strength and the timing of this coupling predicted the
- [14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=888s) individuals working memory and then that the GCS was optimized for this back in the prefrontal cortex and attempt at temporal parietal regions and that was related with working memory games so from one side we have this data beta that you can see here that it's related to working memory and it's related to by the indifferent and context of information perceptual and information from different senses and from the other side we have another copying function which is being grown up in the latest years which is the Delta beta phase
- [15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=931s) amplitude capping this has been shown to be related with top-down processing processing both in cognitive control and in effect regulation I have identified two different studies here one has own enhanced frontal Delta beta carbon and this carbon was associated with increased risk for anxiety problems in a population which that this population if I remember well had family issues and the second study so that the Delta beta park in the left frontal part of the brain was related to impulsivity in bipolar this in biberon
- [16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=971s) disorder patients so taking these findings into account and combining them with the fact that we know that the autism spectrum disorder individuals they deal with most of this regulation issues we applied this algorithm in in this population and these are preliminary results I have to admit and with that we found in these results a higher Delta beta phase amplitude caffeine for the ASD and I'll put you other population compared to the typical developing individuals again in line so we believe that probably this finding
- [16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1013s) can indicate if effect this regulation issues in the in the ASD population okay so to sum up what we have seen so far we have gone from the brain dynamics from the brain from the power of the G signals and the single power between within its band to the cross crib frequency coupling and we have seen and what it spans is related to and then the cross frequency back up in between two different frequency bands for example the theta to gamma and face until you happen that it's related to binding information from difference in sub
- [17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1059s) sensory inputs and then we have also seen for them for the cross frequency copying that the delta to beta Chris frequency coupling is related to top-down processing of effects regulation so the question would be okay if we move to brain complexity then what will bring complexity be related to how is this measured and what is related to and we already saw that we had a hypothesis of course frequency coupling so why the cross frequency a beam would work however in this case for them for the complexity of the brain they the
- [18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1099s) thing is that we don't have a common definition there is not a common definition they can say what complexity is but there are different norms there are different theories and there are different notions today we are mainly going to focus you to the algorithmic theory of complexity but before going there I wanted to present to you like a toy example and how complexity would work in a very simple problem so imagine that you have a full system and then imagine that this full system is like really connected or the nodes are
- [18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1133s) connecting with each other etc and then imagine that you have a reduction in the number of the components or a deduction the company infraction between the components or even adding noise to the system all of these situations are going to create different complexity in your system so one of the theories of the complexity is there is a famous algorithm complexity theory which is based on the Kolmogorov complexity and the Kolmogorov complexity suggests that the signal that you are going that you're measuring for example the easy
- [19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1171s) signal is the result of a problem and then the sorted program that creates that reduces this signal as an output the length of this probe program would be the complexity of our own signal so there is an idea behind the signal that you see there is an idea that there is a program that is very short and has generated this signal and that can be actually pretty simple this problem so the length of the service of the simplest program that generates your output is the complexity of the sample okay the Kolmogorov complexity is
- [20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1208s) uncomputable but there is a proxy to it which is called the lentils deep complexity and 11 seed complexity is considered an upper bound of Kolmogorov complexity this limited complexity actually measures the effectiveness of binary sequences and it creates a dictionary out of new symbols while scanning the whole binary binary sequence under investigation so imagine that you have a sequence full of zeros and ones since it's a binary sequence and then it starts from the first zero the algorithm he puts it in dictionary
- [20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1242s) its guns through it banks and one it puts it into a dictionary then he finds a zero zero he puts it into a dictionary a zero one and so on so forth until it has reached the whole sequence and then the final complexity is going to be the length of your dictionary in bits so now imagine a very nice notion of this theory and the father actually complexity theories is that imagine that you have an output like yes that you can see here which is full of numbers that do not make any sense they seem completely random to you however there
- [21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1281s) is an equation that has generated these numbers so this equation is very very simple so this is the idea the idea is that we go from apparent complexity to simplicity and instead of occupying let's say ourselves with the complex output we are trying to say to find the simple structures that they have created this complex complex outputs I would like to quote here Einstein one who the nice things he said he said make everything as simple as possible but not simpler so let's see later on why why is that what is happening with too much
- [21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1318s) simplicity apart from the Kolmogorov complexity there are a lot of different theories and there are a lot of different complexity measures which you can see here now also there are some measures based on fractal dimension which is based on another theory which is the chaos theory but I'm not going to talk in this talk about this due to time limitations otherwise I would love to and so we have the good destructor dimension we have the normalized intensity dimension of female covers the non-stationarity index
- [22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1357s) permutation entropy all of these they measure in their own way at the complexity of the Signum sometimes they are related to each other through our low or linearly or in with any other kinds of lows so let's focus here we're gonna focus on the length and sleep complexity and let's see what we can do release how does this work in the brain so what we have shown recently again I am going to go back to the packing since this is population since I already explained to you a little bit how this order works in this case so what we did
- [23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1396s) here is we started from the spectrograms of the age assignments to estimate little impulsive complexity you can start from the spectrograms you can even start from the single the single EGF box or you can even start from stack in the envelopes the important thing is that you need to binarize you sequence whatever that may be the best binarization criteria to our knowledge is the [[median binarization]] because this way we get rid of the of the outliers and it's not sensitive to power changes so let's say that we threshold our
- [23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1432s) spectrograms with respect to the median values and then we assign the 0 1 for the values that are higher than the median and then where we assign this value 0 for the values that are below the media and then we come up with this with the complexity with a matrix that only has ones and zeros we enter this into our algorithm then we get the final complexity measure in this case we found decreasing complexity with this is progression as you can see here so the healthy control have higher complexity than the RBD
- [24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1469s) which has higher complexity than the beanie and the higher complexity than the deal B so this is why I want to remain to remind you of that nice quote that you can go simple simple school but not but not overdo it okay in this plot I try to summarize the findings of some studies at risk remind that this plot is qualitative is not quantitative not all conditions have been compared with all conditions that are next to them but I found it very helpful for me to understand what is going on in different situations with respect to the
- [25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1510s) complexity and then I wanted to share this with you as well so in this medium plane you can see the healthy controls that so the healthy spectrum and there from the right you can see two disorders depression and schizophrenia worse on the other extreme we have MCs that stands for minimally conscious to 8:00 p.m.
- [25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1536s) CST merchants from minimally conscious state Parkinson's disease anesthesia uws that stands for unresponsive wakefulness in demand access leads it refers to the better that if stayed patient so I'm not going to go through all of them I don't want to tire you but I just mean I will just mention that for example for depression and schizophrenia how has complexity served and what does it mean in this case high complexity so it was found in this paper of Lea tile in 2008 quite an old paper actually what was fine it was that they group the patients of
- [26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1575s) depression as a friend they had higher complexity both during resting state and during an arithmetic task compared to healthy controls this elements so what they the waiting to prep they interpreted it the result is that they thought that there was like an excessive increase of neuron participation to solve a task like the similar tasks that could be probably served with less neuron participation has happened in a highly controlled state also it's very interesting to mention here that the results another paper more
- [26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1610s) recent paper which I'm not citing here that showed decrease of complexity with antidepressant medication for the for the case of depression another paper would have indicating the highest corner of the healthy spectrum was published in 2017 and it was a study between it was a study on LSD and a placebo group so what the authors found it was that the LSD group they perceived beach content they had higher complexity compared to the placebo group and then I have to mention that this is an Emmy disturb me but the
- [27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1650s) findings were based again on the the levels of complexity and then they also found they suggested basically that increases in conscious level result would result in increases in consciousness content this is how they interpret is did an increase in complexity in this case now if we go to the other extreme of the spectrum or we find the Engram sleep anesthesia and vegetative state uws patients this I study was not done neither in resting state nor during a cognitive task this study was a cultivation driven protocol
- [28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1691s) through TMS MeV and what they measured it was they did probe so the idea was to probe the brain and see how the brain is reacting to this probe with this complexity measure so what they measured with this probing is the information content in the integration of the output of the cortical ceramic system which is based on the AIT Theory information integration theory which is one of the theories on consciousness and by Tony okay and then what we also did actually within our project luminous and this research was initiated by these articles
- [28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1732s) published actually by Junior who is the CEO of neuroleptics what he identified and what he proposed is based on all of these previous findings etc a theory an algorithmic information theory of consciousness so he argues that we can call may be reality as a mental concept derived from information from completion of information and then we saw that the algorithmic information theory provides a very good natural framework to study in quantified processing and he did identifies two aspects of this one is the structured
- [29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1770s) experience and the other is the information processing so you can see that in this case this case like complexity is used very very differently from what we have seen so far in relation to the single band power and in relation to the cross frequency coupling it's a whole different story I need to say that based on this theory we also did a work that has not been published yet in collaboration with with a group in unique from Hobart prison so in this work what we found actually is increased complexity in the fetus's when we were
- [30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1810s) giving them like more complex auditory sequences and then the question that arose is like is there really if like if is the complexity increasing complexity due to the increase of the auditory sequence is due to a structured experience that comes from the outside is the realistic experience before birth is the question that arose from this study and some like this is really that the current state of the art was happening in the field related to complexity and then another thing that I wanted to mention which I found of great
- [30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1849s) interest is the same people who created the psychedelic study in 2017 they proposed since they saw that ok complexity will be related to consciousness and we found let's say compiler complexity for the for the psychedelic crew compared to a placebo control and they said okay how about trying to apply psychedelics as a treatment for disorders of consciousness so this has not been yet carried out but it's a proposition that was published in 2019 okay um I hope you're following Billy and so we are moving from brain power
- [31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1898s) single dynamics let's say to cross frequency coupling what is happening across different powers how do they synchronize to brain complexity where is this complexity telling us about about things that happen in the brain and they will finally move into brain connectivity now keep in mind the brain complexity can be also measured different brain connectivity but let's go step by step okay so brain connectivity we have different ways of connectivity different definitions again for connectivity we have the [[structural connectivity ]]which 
- [32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1939s) is based on the link of anatomical structures we have the [[functional connectivity]]which is the link of statistical resemble things across distinct regions so in this case we don't need to have an atomic structure and then we have the [[effective connectivity]] which is a link of causal relationships between these distinct regions so then the third case having an idea of the structural connectivity would help a lot interpret the results from the three of them the functional connectivity is the simplest and basically the concept comes from that
- [32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=1974s) when two things happen together they should probably be related we don't have any a priori assumptions on the connective mediums as I said before so we don't take into account the anatomical structures which makes the functional connectivity are more straightforward now we can do the connectivity either in the channel space or the in the source space in this case I am going to focus in this trial space we're gonna manage to give another webinar later on well we can go through the source space in more in more detail
- [33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2009s) but due to time limitations it was impossible to cover all the things I really wanted to UM so in connectivity in the time space you should be careful due to the volume conduction here so for those who not familiar with is the volume conduction basically means comes from the fact that there may be two sources deep in the brain which are sending signals to the cortex which are the signal these signals are acquired by the same electrode so finally if you estimate the connectivity between two different electrodes you don't know if it's
- [34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2046s) because these three records are being functionally connected or if it's because of the same source that is sending this information to both electrodes at the same time so we're going to see later on best let's say practices on how to deal with this point before going there some connectivity measures that you can extract they can be directed if you if we talk about functional connectivity it can be done directly I'm sorry if we talk about functional connectivity and they can be directed if we talk about effective
- [34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2082s) connectivity I remind you that the effective conductivity was about causality of different structures of different brain units so some metrics can include coherent synchronisation likelihood phase lag intakes mutual information face looking value et cetera do I have noted from your tutorial and brain connectivity measures if you are interested in the topic you can have a look at that one another of the difference that is a consequence of the directive nests of the two different connectivity categories is that in the
- [35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2122s) functional connectivity we had a symmetric connectivity matrix whereas for the effective connectivity that would be a symmetric in your case okay so we have a lot of measures so what do we do with them if you're using since we are going to talk to focus more on the channel space connectivity this would apply for people who used for example in over your 8 because anyways with an OB o 8 you would have to eat eternals to find the sources to identify the sources but then if you really want to see what is happening
- [35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2157s) like in terms of connectivity and the best way to do that would be in the channel space so it looks like the best metric to use would be the phase lag index which is insensitive to volume conduction according to Cohen's book it was published in 2014 analyzing your a time series data but if you really want to try different metrics some other recommendations so boil it to avoid boil it in conduction according to the same author would include to focus on negative correlation as like if possible since the positive wants a baby
- [36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2196s) to tell vol conduction and to principally test for temporary lacked connectivity because usually the volume conduction is instantaneous so if you if you take four different time lags then probably this connectivity would be less affected by the volume conduction and finally whenever possible try to do two tests for different drug doses or if you are using pcs you can test for TCMS versus this is versus some condition because the volume code action is expected to be similar across conditions so this would be some recommendations on
- [37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2232s) how to deal with them with a volume conduction problem and still carry out connectivity in the channel space and then once you have estimated your connectivity you can extract some features he presently I'm presenting here some possibilities so you can have like the interims ferry continuity you can have a conductivity which is called hormone topic which would be the connectivity between channels like same channel same channels that would correspond to the one name is going to the other image for example that would
- [37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2268s) be see three words before or that would be p7 with p8 etc then you would have the intra hemispheric connectivity which would be the connectivity within the same hemisphere and then you would have the a tropical activity which would be the connectivity like with the other ms.
- [38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2293s) fer but not the amo topic one so then the interim is ferry connectivity as defined here would include both llamo topic and the adult of the connectivity you can even once you have done that you can even extract some features from the like from the graphs that you have created but unfortunately I will not go on to this topic one research that I wanted to present you in the connectivity it was it I presented I I chose this this paper because for me it actually targets research direction that is quite new and it's been really yeah researched investigated explored I would
- [39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2340s) say nowadays so it is commonly used hyper scanning the hyper scanning refers to the correlation with the collectivity or the interactions or the synchronization between the brains of two different people or of a group of people who are doing the same tasks so it is like a habit scanning like it's like a group measure like a way of measuring group interaction so this paper what they show is that represented a finger tracking tasks both in the real world and in a virtual reality environment and then they estimated they
- [39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2384s) estimated the face looking value from one brain to the other and actually they found that the two brains had very similar connectivity for the two situations for the real gaming and for the edge of a virtual reality gaming even the idea that the virtual reality environment gives a very similar sensation of reality as the real world in this context okay so I hope that you have managed to get a glimpse into the different kind of things that we can do with HD signals ranging from one power to chorus frequency coupling to
- [40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2429s) connectivity into complexity and that you see that they are different ways of looking on the same tool which is actually the brain now before finalizing the talk I would like to show you some potential technological applications one of my favorite ones is on EJ and the Muslims so able to present you the idea a lot of research on emotions and AD is based on these graphs that you can see here which is called the circumflex this real complex has a horizontal and the vertical axis the horizontal axis is called balance and trenches from
- [41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2473s) unpleasant to pleasant and the vertical axis is called arousal and brains is from inactive to active so according to Russell in 1980 who created this model all emotion categories can be depicted in this two-dimensional space so we'll use we're using this space we have developed our own feature based on the features that I have presented previously to you and then from these features we extract the level of balance and arousal for a variety of applications so I want to show you here some one of the applications that we
- [41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2510s) carried out was to go into exhibition to where the inovio with the sdk card and record the eg signals crosses them extract features correlate them with a balance in the router and then rate the paintings that these people were watching when they were moving in the museum exhibition so like this we could help Museum exhibitors - even if they want it for example if they wanted yes - to change to redistribute the paintings so that for example if there were like more boring paintings concentrating in one room so that they would place them all
- [42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2552s) over the place so that the people would be kept like in a very good emotional level that was one application another application that we are currently doing in collaboration with corporate visions that is a communications company is that we are proposing we are trying to find the best tool possible so that we communicate what we communicate in a way that the person is going to learn that and to remember it so that it so that when they perceive it they are they feel happy and we have the ear attentive and motivated etc and we are doing this
- [43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU1NM1Jl4a0&t=2593s) through a variety of videos players presentations website different video techniques etc to find out what is the best way to communicate the message to the people who need to receive it and finally we have been doing a lot of different exhibitions for example you can use the same features map them to valence and arousal in real-time scenarios and create music from your eg signals out of these features and then participate to expose them to different kinds of expositions well thank you very much
