# On EEG's generative mechanism
# Notes
>[!quote]
>Theory-laden eyes can see a phenomenon through the generative mechanism (i.e. can solve the inverse problem)
+ While the hypothesis that the [[Thalamus]] can induce cortical rhythmic activity makes sense based on the former's ability to generate rhythmic activity (some nucleus) it has already been refuted by later studies.
+ Important to remember that spindles are not the same as frequency bands, even if the PSD overlaps. [[Fernando H. Lopes da Silva]] has shown that the alpha band comes from the laminar cortical structure.

+ Neural synchrony is a generator of EEG. Besides this, it is apparent that the [[Thalamus]] is highly involved in EEG data and the oscillatory mode activity from the whole cortex (global field theory of the brain).

--------------------------------

hello everyone thank you Jamie uh hello everyone uh it's my pleasure to uh introduce for a second time uh Dr Makoto makoshi who um is going to be talking to us uh today uh the title of his talk is on eeg's generative mechanism and um Makoto has said that if there are things that are not clear um or burning questions that you have that you should please interrupt him that's right Moto right yes yeah please okay so uh Makoto the floor is yours thank you so let me share my screen okay and start my presentation okay do you see my slide uh yes perfectly okay thanks okay um so today I'm going to talk about the the generative mechanism of EEG and I think this having this um Insight is very important because um if we have that good understanding that means our eyes are well Theory Laden and if we have a theory Laden eyes we can see the phenomenon through the generative mechanism so that is that is the same as we see the phenomena from the standing point of the the forward model like this the beginning of the forward model and we are seeing the phenomenon as a result of the assumed mechanism so let me explain what it means so this is the classical Erp of the mismatch negativity by n in um almost 45 years ago and we see the difference in erps and this difference comes from the fact that the standard is the the Erp response to the and the signal is a you know this is a deviation from the background context so that generates the Erp difference great um but what do we see here what kind of brain mechanism can you predict from here or what what is going on inside the brain what is the you know the brain correlate of or you know whatever this electop physiological correlate of this phenomenology um in yourp difference and this is a part of it right uh the EEG is generated as an result of the interaction between Thalamus and cortex and Thalamus has reticular nucleus and reticular nucleus works as a inhibitory you know mechanism and the cortical layer has five or six major layers and those layers have differential receives the differential um modulation and control by the different uh camic nuclei and those uh layers generates the different uh um the activities which is you know um studied by the Latos recent so there there is a 45 almost 40 years difference between this nend study and the lados study in 2020 so this is the inverse problem we see so if we can explain the background activities like this including all of these mechanisms then then we can say that um we have a good understanding of the but it's not perfect but it's still a good um explanation we have and if we have this another thing we can do is to make the forward model that is how we build the similar machine or mechanism that generates the Erp like phenomena so this is one example of such a forward model called uh hnn human neocortical neuros solver so we basically simulate the um the cortical mechanism and camic inputs and eventually this um simulation environment generat the oscillatory you know um EEG or meeg signal like um output so uh using this forward model you know we can make more um interesting studies that's the benefit of having a good generative model model in our mind now um today I'm going to focus on this central question which is where do EG rhythms originate from because this is also the has been the central question of the history of the EEG at least in the 20th century um so I will go back way um more to the point of the End of the World War I um there was um one study that showed that um isolated thamus can show the oscillation and this is a decorticated cat salams decorticated probably means you know the the cortex is functionally at least you know um dissociated um so this means that um okay salus has this gism generator so at least salus is a one good candidate to show that Rhythm which is called the spindles and the natural extension of that idea is now this under and under 1967 they said that um well actually I I cited one of the the sentences here which contains two important mistakes later refuted the first one is that uh they said any thalamic nucleus was capable of inh exhibiting rhythmic oscillation this was not true actually some salic nucleus do not show rmic activities another another important um the statement they made was that um the Rhythm generated inside the salus would then be imposed on the cortex via Salam cortical cells so this idea is probably still um believed by some of the E researchers who do not um have you know who who who who have haven't read um those uh studies on on this issue but um this is as if the thamus is only the Rhythm Center and the cortex is um just U driven by the salams but recent studies showed there is interactions between salams and cortex and also cortical cortical connection can show some rmic oscillations by the way on the right side of the panel I show the tractography of the Salam Cal radiations this is basically covering the entire cortex not surprisingly so this means where cortex is seen there is the camic connectivities and differential different thalamic nucleus have um different you cortical controls as shown in this Piper 2022 paper now um I want to start with this Studies by a series of studies by stereid and he focused on the spindles and spindles is um it's a form of oscillation and he found that um one of the important pamic nucleus reticular nucleus has three oscillatory modes uh Delta Alpha and Gamma and this rings a bell to us right it's like aha we know these frequency bands and he also found that uh this 7 to4 Herz which is practically the alpha band um is associated with the resting membrane potentials so this means that um if we observe the 7 to 14 Heartz oscillation in this particular um uh nucleus then the via the thoral um the connection the EEG power at the cortex should be reduced right so there must be such um enti correlation between this reticular formation in the cortical uh electric activities so that's the prediction and later using the pet um the Larson and colleagues showed that uh indeed when they observed the increase of the regional cerebral metabolic rate in within the thamus then the simult simultaneously recorded EEG power dropped so the B um the the blood flow increases in in the salic region then the EEG power went down this particularly the alpha power went down so um this reticular formation is a inhibitory mechanism of the salic activity so this is the the increase of the reticular formation activity is putting the putting the foot on the The Brak right and that um the in I'm not good at this double negative but anyway um yeah this the the this inhibition and um you know this process is here but later uh there was another important findings made by Lopez Silva and he said um The Well studied spindle phenomena is actually not the same as Alpha and the the reason the reason for that is number one um stereid and colleagues used cats um but Lopez the Silva said actually cats are not a good model animal model for the human EEG and actually dogs are much better as a human EEG model because the alpharithm they showed is similar to um the humans alpharithm and also um this um spindola phenomena was mainly studied by during during the sleep or anesthesia but you know the alpha rithm during sleep is not um not very uh dominant right so um the the sleep or anesthesia is associated with the very low Consciousness level but um usually Alpha is observed during the awake state so those two um different experimental situations and in fact when when the authors compared the the actual recordings of the alpha and spindles from salamis and recorded from the salamis and cortex they showed different Peak um frequency Powers so they they are not the same and later um using the Meg um these Al showed that the the source of the spindles and alphas and Central mu are all different so Alpha and spindles are unfortunately two different things we have to admit that um the same author the lest of silver also found in different papers that um the actually the source of the alpha oscillation is in the cortical lamina structure he what he did here is he used this depth recordings and you know um this needle electrode has uh maybe three Mill three or four millimeters in length that penetrates the you know six layers of the cortex and The Superficial layers those electrod shows um the peak along with this axis but this peak gradually shifts its phase to the trough and when he plotted this phase difference in this way then he found a sudden change from uh between the electr 23 and 22 um almost 180 degrees polarity difference this means that there is a positivity here and there is a negativity here or you know the opposite but you know um there is a polarity reversal this indicates that there is a dipole current dipole here so this Alpha is actually generated inside the cortex cortical layer systems um this finding was later validated in this way this is only one of the studies that have um you know validation effect um there may be other good studies which I missed but um you know this is another um laminina structure recordings and this is from The Superficial and this is from the the the Deep layers and what we see here is that um basically this frequency range here is in a higher gamma band like above 50 Heartz to up to 200 Heartz but this gamma band activity is um temporary organized in low frequency very like up down up down up and this up down up down rason is in the Delta frequency so this is a typical example of the phase amplitude coupling so this phase is defined by this low frequency Delta and that regulates the activity of this High gamma band first like um and what they found was that this um phase amplitude coupling comes from The Superficial layers and not the Deep layer so there are this layer specific um activities and modulations and those layers are later which which I will later explain differentially controlled by the camic um the camic connections this is another example of uh and this is kind of rare um visualization of the depth by depth um visualization ation and this shows that um Alpha Source comes from 800 micrometer above the granular layer level so that that means 800 micrometer um higher than with the middle granular layers and Gamma source is from the minus 300 micrometer that that means deep so this Alpha force and Gamma Force are differentially um modulated and generated in in different um depths of the layers and again the different depth means different camic um controls so let me summarize the the difference between the spindles and Alpha so spindles were studied by stereid and you know the recorded during the anesthesia or sleep and they were mostly studied by cat and they studied very you know well so this the generative mechanism of the spindle is very well studied actually that's that's a great Advance on the other hand um the alpha which is what we observe in EEG studies um the lope the Sila pushed these studies and recorded during the awake period and mainly dogs were used but U the Ser mechanism of the alpha generation is actually not very well known at least at the point of 1990 when this paper was written so um you know here here is one unfortunate thing for for us EEG researchers um spindles are not Alpha but spindle is spindles are much better studied and but we want to know Alpha but how can we applied our understanding of the spindles to the alpha you know that's the question because again um the alpha was not as well studied as the spindles by the way um I found one interesting thing um when I when I used the pbet to search the word Alpha spindle which is a very confusing um term you know if you think about those differences between the spindle and Alpha and how long this research spent on differentiating those two concepts and the the term Alpha spindle seems to appear after 2009 that's like 20 30 years after you know this authors studies this phenomena very well so I think this means that um the EG researchers forgot about this difference and we are you know getting back to the pre uh stere create lest silver era and we don't know the difference between spindle and Alpha so this is how the the variable research results were become forgotten by the Next Generation so we have to remember those great studies so the conclusion at that point is that um the spindle can be the model of alpha so even though the spindle is not exactly the alpha itself but because spindle is very well studied um it should serve as a some kind of model of the alpha so that's a analogical thing but not exactly the alpha itself F so this conclusion concluding remark was made in the 1990 paper which is supposed to be one of the most sted preferences in the field so um thamus drives and mediates cortical cortical coher expence and this is again the study by Lopez Silva In 1980 this is one I think one of the most important studies in the history of EG in terms of this Salam cortical connections uh what he did is this this is a dog the cortex and there are two recording sites electr 8 and elect 15 and when he measured the ordinary coherence between these two electr Loc and there this is the the power Spectrum density of the coherence um not the power Spectrum density but coherency and not surprisingly there is a peak around the alpha frequency band this is orinary coherence now he applied the partial coherence and the the partial coherence means um the coherence between this is still the coherence between the elect 8 and 15 but the difference is this is after subtracting the common influence from electr 13 so this is like a residual by after subtract after subtracting the the common influence from the electro 13 so if this is a residual okay um if we don't see much Alpha Peak here it means that um this ordinary coherence Peak at the alpha range is actually the common input um from the elector 13 that's why after um subtracting this out you don't see much so that means um you know maybe the the elect 13 is a you know sends a common drive to those two electr that's why those two electr are you know synchronously um activated so using this computational Tool uh what they did is that now they evaluated the cortical cortical connections um but you know taking into account the salic input which is a lateral geniculate nucleus in this case and surprisingly there is not much difference between these two this means that lateral geniculate nucleus has little to do with this U Cal cortical coherence but what they found was that um it was actually the Pinar that com moderate the cortical cortical um conne connections connectivities at the alpha range so this big Alpha Peak disappeared that means the Palina uh sent the common Drive these two cortical cortical recording site so this is um this is same as the theoretical pamic deafferentation so so that's like um um computationally cutting the the input from the Solus based on these beautiful studies um they concluded that um The Pina uh affects the cortex cortical connectivity more than the lgn and later um there was this study uh published from science and this Palina moderation of the cortical cortical connection was actually the the um the substrate of the top down attention so they used the top down attention task visual task using monkeys and there is a q special Q shown and you know they asked the animal if this cued position showed both TI or not and this is ABCD is um um time frequency decomposition of this uh data and you see you know between attention on and off conditions uh when the top down attention is on then there is always a strong Pina to V4 um uh gr cality at around the alpha frequency range this is a great um validation of the studies but again I noticed that um those authors these are apparently the the Imaging researchers using um MRI um they did not site the lope silver study in the 1980 so this is again the the evidence of those know next Generation forget okay the um the former Generations good achievement so we have to remember these good studies um so that was a very nice clarification on this aspect of the the Salam cortical relations which is a coupling so salamis can control the coupling between the different cortical regions and their activities now uh because we are interested in clinical studies then this Salam cortical dmia is a critical concept for all of us and one common findings between I mean among the the variable um clinical status such as depression Parkinson's disease tinitus and neuro neurogenic pain um they commonly showed the the number number one the alpha Peak shift from higher to lower frequencies and also the power overall power increase uh as shown in this right side panel and this common features are now um referred to as Salam corticol drimia and our groups also have um reported the very similar findings um like schizophrenia patient showed um lower frequency and higher power Alpha and increased gamma and this is a comparison between control and fragile ex syndrome children and they they showed a markedly you know lower Alpha frequency and increased power in in the peak frequency range and the gamma tail part as well what I like about this lenus 1999 paper is that um this author uses a very uh impactful word so um as as a foreign and non-english native English speakers it's easier to understand such as oh you know this this is all the sightings from the papers but they said the Mind R Bar mode so when the salus mind bar then this disturbs the the normal cortical activities what they also said the this pathological State the the Salam is stuck in spindle like activities they also said um there there is an abnormal low frequency oscillatory attractor so once that attractor you know captures the Salam States then it's hard to get out of there getting out of there means the disorder is cured right um but this attractor is in a sense in in the EEG representation you know the the associated phenomena of the the disease State and um this abnormal ceramic activities can be further connected to the membrane hyperpolarization or type to C A2 plus Channel D inactivation so you know there there is a further you know um underlying physiology of these phenomenon and that can be pursued um by the other researchers and importantly U some of the deep brain stimulation application or camic Legions aim at reducing this um some specific part of Sal so this is like a proof of concept by um using the disease template to prove that um there is specific thical circuit that can go wrong and that can be cured this is the model they proposed in their paper which is not in my opinion super helpful or particularly beautiful but you know we have to stick to this figure and um I I'm not going to explain the detail of this figure here but interestingly this figure has been used to repeatedly in in in know later Publications by other researchers even so this is a later validation um uh this is the slice study so they they sliced the fet Solus and so conveniently this this slice contains both reticular nucleus and soral neurons um and they delivered the electric stimulation to the Salam cortical neurons and they recorded the electric responses within the reticular nucleus reticular nucleus is again um it's it's a break on the system and this is before the uh electric Del and this is the stimulus D so this is the the model of um deep brain stimulation basically using the feret and before delivering the stimulus um this uh is the blowup of the first box a and under this long spikes you see the exact sinusoidal but you know the rmic activity is here right this is spindles and this is the gener generator of the EG by the way so if you further blow up this one of the three trins of um the spindles and E then there is a low frequency bump and a spike is on top of this low frequency bump so we can see the the generative principle of the the EEG itself here so you know this low frequency s can be um Can overlap very well after averaging um so this can make Um this can accumulate and you know reach to the point that um this uh the summary of this uh epsb um can make a significant contribution to the sculp recorded EG and also you notice that um the spikes here um only occurs at the top of this wave so this is the the phase amplitude coupling so there is a low frequency phase like boom boom boom and this high frequency thing only happens when this this low frequency goes up so this is the also the generative principle of the phase amplitude coupling after stimulus presentation um know this um this pathological spindle is gone it's it's silent right and after some time it will be back with the spindles so um from the microscopic electr logical Viewpoint uh this spindle is a bad thing but of course this spindle means this action potentials as well um so these these things are clarified and validated later in this way um that lenus 1999 I think is the explanation about the activity so when we see the sculp recorded EG then that is that is you know um what's the generative mechanism of that well you know if if it shows the pathological signs then probably the Salam nucleus and particularly the reticular nucleus is not working well so that Thalamus is bursting in the Mindless way as Lena said in in the paper uh there is another interesting property of the salus which helps us to connect the micro and macroscopic uh special scales um in this paper these authors um argue the difference between the Matrix cell and um the core cell and core and Matrix difference is that uh this blue is the Matrix and Matrix means diffusive and you know this diffusive thing goes everywhere in the brain but um the core means um it it it moderates specific functions such as motor and you know those some of these specific functions and interesting fact is that this Matrix projects to The Superficial layers and the core projects to the Deep layers and this is the within salus distribution of the Matrix and core cells so the anterior part is mainly the metrix cells and posterior part is the mainly the Cor cells and this is a matrix cell projection destinations and these are the core destination core core cell projection destinations and I immediately notice that this core core cells are associated with the brain region that shows a beautiful erps like visual evok potentials or you know whatever this um motor related M rism or stuff like that and Matrix C well I would say maybe one exception of my assumption I mean the hypothesis is the eror related negativity you know the eror related negativity shows a very nice Erp patterns but overall you know this orbito frontal or frontal regions I I don't expect a beautiful um phase reset nice erps from these regions so I maybe core Matrix difference is also related to the you know the Erp observability and in fact this core um Matrix cells uh core core cells are you know have projection to the the deeper layers and deeper layer means um the the dipole going to be large right so maybe that's that's why um core projection shows a nice earpiece but but I could be wrong here that's just a assumption so um that is also about the coupling like how thamus can um control the coupling between the neurons or the cluster of the neurons between the cortical columns um so this is another um example which I liked is that um this is a this is fmri studies I believe and when they correlate between specific Sal salic regions activations with the PCA dimensions of the brain States so PCA Dimension simply means if the brain oscillation or bold signal activation mode has simple like you know a simple mode or complex mode like this and they found that this C the camic nucleus shows a a strong negative correlation between the PCA dimensionality so this means that um when this salus activates more then brain starts to activate in a more simple mode simpler mode and um we can hear use the Matrix and core separation again and GED this orar reported this region so this region I I believe Falls within this Matrix cell region and you know metric cell covered um the frontal regions and that I think bro broadly agrees with this prediction made by um the authors and which prob probably overlap somewhat with this dorsal attention Network so we can make this kind of conjectures based on this results I think that relates to the topology so how salus controls the the cortical activities although know these most of these are more or less overlapped as this as this um the authors admit that at least four partially overlapping can only function so these separations are not AAL and this is an interesting study from back in the 70s what they did is was to um to inject some poison uh took from the the puff fish Petr Toxin and what it does is to to silence the the EEG as can be seen here so this is a baseline EEG recorded from uh some animal and this is a 10 minutes after tetrodotoxin injection so you can see know the appearance of um silent period and the overall amplitude are somewhat reduced and that continues for another 10 minutes and they studied this the the correlation between the intracellular spiking activities and the EEG so in this case EEG is a microscopic um recordings and intracellular means microscopic right and what they found oh by the way this is a stard sleep and awake without tetor toxin this is after injecting the tetor toxin what they found was that um inell activities were not silenced very much but EEG activities were very well silenced so if I summarize the point it's going to be like this this is a exaggerated um schematic illustration but the point is that the claim is that um intracellular activities were less affected but sculp EG was very much affected so they concluded that um uh actually tetrodotoxin affects the the this C synchrony and not the spiking activity per se and I I think this argument is a bit strange but this is a very highly valued um study in in the field I run also um simple simulation using ma lab and assuming some of the the given values like each neuron contribute 0.01 mic micr volt which was used by eoll um this is the comparison between group of neurons and they are all randomly activated and as you increase the number of the neurons then the measured e EEG amplitude increases in this way and compared with that um this is only 1% of the neural population get activated but in complete synchrony like 100% synchrony and 99% of the other neurons are dead silent okay and when you make this comparison there is um a point where um this um synchrony model goes beyond the the total amplitude level of the the random neuron firing this way and of course this 1% synchronized is underestimation because because 99% of the other neurons must be still randomly firing right so this red line must be more than this but this is for the sake of the comparison and according to the Nunes and S baton we have to have this much cortical area to produce the sculpt measurable EEG that is assumed to be something like five to the 10 to the S neurons that is well within this which is 1% synchrony overwhelms the random Mass Effect according to this Meg researchers they even showed this figure in this paper and they said that if they actually have one square cm um of the cortex with only 1% of the synchronization which is this line then they can measure the Meg signal from there this is surprising right we talk about oh neural synchrony neural synchrony but with this you know the Mass Effect um only 1% of the synchrony makes the difference so we don't need to have 50% synchrony or something like that just 1% um is fine and because in the case of the EEG it's not one square cenm but six square cenm this means um um you know this graph goes far far right and we don't even need 1% we probably need 0.1% or much less um ratio of the synchrony to to record the um you know 20 30 microvolt of the EEG on on the sculp so we have to have this um basic numbers to have a right Insight of the neural synchrony you know we shouldn't talk about 80% synchrony but 0. 1% synchrony that's what that makes a difference so that's the neural coupling um yeah probably I can stop here because this is a good point to stop or I can move further if if you want I mean you have a few you have a few more minutes if you want like maybe five okay five yeah please Contin really quick okay thanks um this is another very important study from the 1965 and this is uh extremely surprising for me when I saw this for the first time so they did a very simple study using the this this piece of the skull removed from the patient and they they put this this is the the skull fresh skull wet and this is a poly polyan layer which is non-conductive and they put the punch hole probably using the needle and this is the you know um cotton soaked in sing water and this is the low frequency oscillator and they measured the the electric potential difference here um reference to somewhere else um so the the what they studied was the the difference in the ratio between this generator's voltage and the measured voltage and the when there was only the single pin hole then the measured voltage here was uh 20,000 times smaller than this generators and they increased the number of these pin holes to the uh area to the you know uh the the area of the 1 square cm then attenuation rate becomes much smaller 400 to1 and when they reached about one square inches then it's 2 to1 and this is a 10,000 times different and I it was almost incredible I when I presented this in front of my colleagues no one believed it and uh it's it's very difficult for me at the time to understand why this happens um so by the way this is the the reason why um you know today people talk about this one square inches and this was further later supported by Paul Nunes theoretical and empirical studies and these are the um the surprising examples they showed in the paper this is a subdural electrode and this is a sculp electrode and when the subdural shows this activity sculp are pretty much silent and of course the question is why are they not showing a good correlation and um this is a very extreme example they applied 50 molts between these two electrodes this is a human head by the way and this is the EEG recordings and when they add added 50 molt here they measured 10 microvolt difference here why why is this effect so small right another example is you know between these two electrod they applied like 850 molt I don't know what happens to the brain at this point but they only measured like 25 microvolt difference in in the electrode right above these Electro stimulating electrod so this ratio is like 5,000 to one or 34,000 to one and you know um between the electrode 83 and 84 which is only few millimeters separate but there is no volume conduction effect and why why is that and also the O2 which is the recording from the surface scull scul sculp surface and AT3 84 there is very poor correlation between electrodes so why is that why where is the volume conduction effect right um and this is also um the very often quoted a comment by gray Walter he said when when he measured Alpha activities uh practically adjacent and almost congruent one field he could still observe a variety of alphar rithms so in in cical recordings this happens so we have to uh take it as a as a fact and the explanation is this so um if you think about the single dipole and let's say there is a 8 mm um the distance within inside the brain so that is actually this replicating this condition you know the electr positions are 8 mm apart and the recordings are just different you know this is only 8 millimeters apart but elector 71 shows huge spikes but 70 doesn't show that at all um so if you apply this standard theory of the volume conduction and and the the the dipole model it's going to be like this uh this attenuation rate is huge like 200 times or something like that or 60 to 200 times um and this is the comparison between on axis potential and off off AIS potentials and this is by the way the simulation I run um so not surprisingly this on axis U measurement shows much larger potential at around this point and that gradually decays in this way and this off axis is not that big so there is no not much um benefit of this off axis measurement but um because there are a lot of this off off axis contributors in the field much more than the you know on axis contributors and that ratio is about 1 to 130 in this simulation so 5 degre Circle compared with the 45° Circle and there are much more right 50 degree circle 60 degree circle is possible so this ratio is still conservative so um if we think about the dipoles we should actually think about the a lot of dipole like a dipole layer like this and even though the on AIS on axis off AIS difference is about three times uh because there are 130 times more off AIS contributors these off AIS contributors can overwhelm the on-axis contributor so um in the end you know when you compare the single dipole and dipole layer um dipole layer is so robust against the distance dependent um attenuation um to when you know for example the measurement point is about 10 mm separate from the The Source then if you have this much dipole layer which is Again by this is a number by suggested by nun and serin bason um the dipole sheet has 26 times less distance dependent attenuations this is a very important generative model of the EEG uh so this means means that um how much voltage we can measure as an EEG actually is largely U dominated by how large the source is not like how strong the source is how large and again the the the synchron synchronization ratio we observed was you know um it tells us that it only needs like less than 1% of the synchrony okay um those are the all the presentations I prepared for today thank you very much thank you that's wonderful do you wna um stop sharing and we can see if anybody has um uh questions sure great um well I'll start okay I have questions but I well I want to I just want to make a comment first which is that I really appreciate your um presenting and citing um the classic older work um I think too often we're in situations where um uh it is it is in cited and um uh people publish and as if they're rediscovering or discovering something which really in terms of these classic studies that you presented um has already been elegantly uh done I agree I I just have a very uh specific question I was really interested in your um uh description of spindles uhuh uh and EEG uh and I was reminded of uh EEG in pre-term and very new born infants and the characterization of what are called sleep spindles uhuh um and I'm wondering if if that characterization in the EG is um what you were referring to I mean I know obviously it's it's scalp recorded EG but I was just wondering if it was uh a similar characterization um uh I am not in the position to give that a definitive answer because I'm not um I'm not necessarily the spe of this uh spindle Alpha difference I I do sleep research and the sleep spindles are what he's discussing and they the the lamic contribution to those and the reticular nucleus has been very well characterized that that's what I thought yeah but you don't see it you see it in during sleep and in in in premature uh and newborn infants right sorry it's it's actually a characteristic rhythm of sleep yeah it characterizes non-r sleep even in the newborns well the newborn rhythms are a little bit different so I don't I don't know the degree so I haven't studied sleep in in babies that much um I believe that the spindling still occurs but the duration and magnitudes differ in the little ones and I'm I'm not familiar with the pre-term literature at all so mostly I'm talking about adults hey we have time for a few questions anybody hey makot this oh okay go ahead we have Jim and then John so Jim oh okay so here's the question question that pops up in my mind when I look into these uh studies these 40 50 60 year studies of the generative nature of EEG um they tend to all be very descriptive they tell us that a lot of regions have a lot of roles well I mean that's great worked from 40 years ago um what I'm really interested in is a prediction or a model or a way to help interpret my data how can I use these data in a way that can help explain something about cortical eizz that I wouldn't have in another way and I I'll give you know one example just from the work you presented that popped up in my mind for example work from Max Shin's lab of those different topologies that are related to different camic networks that looks like something you could take a cortical mask of and use as say a prior or something for a source estimation procedure which I've never seen anyone do and I don't think our field is really trying to take the history and move forward to empirically constrain or predict novel predictions so if you have any I'd love to hear them so um I briefly mentioned about the human neurocortical neuros solver in the beginning but uh I think making such a forward model and make uh predictions and you know like um you know make this a generative mechanism as a as a like a research principle uh to reproduce the the phenomena is a one way to go although brain is notoriously complex and some of some of the smart e researchers like Paul Nunes is completely um pessimistic about such forward model predictions um but like because um well it depends on what kind of predi predictions those researchers have but if if such a prediction is mainly focusing on the nonlinear interactions and emerging phenomena then you know making a linear model does not help right so that kind of pessimism is there but I still think that you know starting from the simple model is not necessarily a bad thing in science right we all start from the dumb simple model and refines and refines so hnn is I think um a good predic U good direction and in fact our La has been studying collaboration with the the Stephanie Jones the developer of the hnn model and I I'm sure there are many other good models and predictive um studies using those um the the neural models in computers like in cico New Neuroscience we have time for just one question John I know I see you have your hand up so thank you Makoto that was a wonderful talk I wish you would give that to all of our residents and neurophysiologists here at Washington University we have these these theoretical discussions all the time that aren't well bounded by data which is so fantastic that you took the time to think about this one of the things I've often worried about I'm me a pediatric epileptologist is childhood absance epilepsy where you have this massive High amplitude three htz spike and wave activity or in infantile spasms where you have hips rythmia we always argue about how many neurons that really is particularly involves particularly when it's showing up all over the cortex you know we're not just talking about a patch of Cortex have you thought about this or have any any general thinking on how we should think about these very high amplitude large areas of cortical activation um well I I think it's apparent that um thalamic this regulation is involved here but also there is a such a thing as a global field theory of the brain and um I think those two things must be considered in that case um particularly if you talk about this U rather large areas involved then the oscillation mode of the entire cortex I think is um we cannot we cannot um neglect so um but um not many e researchers are aware of this Global field Theory and I I I believe this is one of the things actually that was you know the example of the Forgotten you know good um Neuroscience from the last century um so definitely Solus but potentially the global field Theory so those are the two things I would consider and there is also um like a nonlinear physics based um studies like um what's what was the term like um um limit cycle model and stuff like that which I'm not very familiar with but it seems this a large area oscillation with a relatively low spal um mode frequency mode um is a is a that's something you know single unit recording researchers cannot explain very well right because this is ill mode issue rather than you know single unit or you know the salom cortical specific Loop but it's a entire system oscillations there are those studied in excellent research but these research are very difficult to understand because it requires a very deep knowledge of the physics so that's what I can say sorry about it okay unfortunately we do have to stop listen this was great really very very much appreciate uh the talk that you gave uh today and um as I put into the chat this will uh the recording will be available on Confluence for hbcd people if you're interested and you're not hbcd and you're interested in the recording um just write us and we'll be happy to share the link so Makoto thank you so much again wel uh and everybody have a good day bye.
