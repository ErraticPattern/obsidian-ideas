# Spinal nerves (31 pairs)

Divided into ventral, lateral, and dorsal sides. It is found within the [[vertebral column]] divided into: 7C, 12T, 5L, 1S, 1C – 26 vertebras (in adults; babies have 33 vertebras). Each vertebra consists of a vertebral body and arch, which surround the [[spinal cord]], present in the [[vertebral foramen]] (the C7 [[vertebra]] is the first one to be felt).

Spinal cord consists of 31 pairs of spinal nerves – 8C, 12T, 5L, 5S, 1C; it extends from C1 to L1/L2 vertebras (to L3 in newborns). The spinal cord is the same size as the vertebral column until the third month in intrauterine life; thereafter, the vertebral column starts to outgrow the spinal cord.

In the cervical region, where it gives origin to the [[brachial plexus]], and in the lower thoracic and lumbar regions, where it gives origin to the [[lumbosacral plexus]], the [[spinal cord]] is fusiformly enlarged (more grey matter for more innervated muscles). After L1, it tapers off into the [[conus medullaris]] – an extension of pia matter forms the [[filum terminale]]. The structure composed of the nerves, inferior to L1, is called [[cauda equina]].

## Pathways

Figure 66. Principal fiber tracts of the spinal cord.

The [[anterior spinothalamic tract]] and [[lateral spinothalamic tract]] are represented but not labelled. The first carries information for crude touch and the second carries information for pain and temperature.

The [[dorsal column–medial lemniscus]] pathway (DCML) (also known as the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, PCML) is the name given to the pathway that carries sensory information; it goes from the [[Dorsal column]] to the [[medial lemniscus]], and then to the thalamus, finishing in the cortex.

Figure 67. Information regarding the ascending and descending pathways of the spinal cord.

Except for [[thoracic nerves]] from T3 to T11, the anterior primary rami of all the spinal nerves join together and/or branch to form a network of nerves known as nerve plexus. There are three major plexuses:

- [[Cervical plexus]]

Neck and diaphragm (phrenic nerve).

- [[Brachial plexus]]

Muscles of upper limb (e.g., medial, ulnar, and radial nerves).

- [[Lumbar plexus]]

Muscles of thighs (e.g. obturator and femoral nerve)

- [[Sacral plexus]]

Muscles of legs (e.g. sciatic, tibial and peroneal nerve)
