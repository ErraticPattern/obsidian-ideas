# Medulla Oblongata

It is continuous with the spinal cord (foramen magnum marks separation); it shares the anterior median fissure and posterior sulcus of the spinal cord. Posteriorly, it contains the gracile and cuneate tubercules, produced by the respective nuclei, which receive the respective fasciculi from the spinal cord.
