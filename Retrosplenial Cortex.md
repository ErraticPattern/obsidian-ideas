# Retrosplenial Cortex (RSC)

It is 100 years since Brodmann delineated the human RSC (areas 29 and 30) within the posterior cingulate region. Early studies characterized the memory impairments following RSC damage as disconnection effects resulting from the interruption of pathways from the hippocampus to either the anterior thalamic nuclei or the frontal cortex.

It does seem incontrovertible that the RSC is important for spatial navigation. Perhaps the biggest challenge lies in linking the RSC’s role in navigation with its involvement in episodic memory, imagination and thinking about the future while being precise about its specific contributions. Furthermore, the RSC is involved in contextual mapping of permanent landmarks, and orientation relative thereto.

Figure 30. Retrosplenial neuroanatomy. Location and principal connections of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). a | Medial surface of a human brain showing the position of the RSC (Brodmann’s areas 29 and 30) (blue) and the remaining posterior cingulate cortex (areas 23 and 31) (green). b | How the RSC can help to integrate information in cortical sensory and prefrontal sites (upper half of the schematic) with subcortical sites required for memory (lower half). c | Principal connections of the macaque (Macaca fascicularis) RSC. The darker arrows indicate denser projections (bicoloured arrows indicate denser projections in the direction indicated by the darker colour)7,16. d | Location and principal connections of the rat RSC; d indicates the dysgranular cortex (area 30); a and b respectively indicate divisions Rga and Rgb within the granular cortex (area 29)12–14. The arrowheads in area 29 do not distinguish between Rga and Rgb. e | A series of coronal sections depicting the location of areas 29 and 30 (the RSC, blue) and area 23 (green) in the posterior cingulate region of M. fascicularis8. Numbers prefixed by ‘A’ indicate the distance (in millimetres) anterior to the auditory meatus8. All other numbers refer to area designations. AD, anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus; AM, anterior medial thalamic nucleus; AV, anterior ventral thalamic nucleus; Caud, caudate nucleus; Clau, claustrum; HF, hippocampal formation; LD, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus; LP, lateroposterior thalamic nucleus; MPulv, medial pulvinar; ParaS, parasubiculum; PH, parahippocampal cortex; Post, postsubiculum; PR, perirhinal cortex; PreS, presubiculum; STSd, dorsal superior temporal sulcus; Sub, subiculum; V4, visual area 4.
