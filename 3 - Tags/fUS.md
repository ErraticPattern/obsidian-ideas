## Parent note

## Functional Ultrasound (fUS)
Better application in newborns, since the [[fontanelles]] allow for the passage of ultrasound waves more readily. It can also be applied in adults, using other methods. Its spatial resolution can reach the 5 Âµm mark. It can be used for observation of red blood cells in the vessels.
