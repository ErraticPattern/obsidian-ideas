## Parent note
[[Brain Imaging techniques]]---
## PET
It captures γ-rays that come from β-decay. It also allows for the 3D reconstruction of the brain and has a resolution of ~5 mm, due to the characteristics of β-decay. One important radiopharmaceutical is the 18F-FDG, which is an analog of glucose uncapable of being metabolized; it accumulates in active neurons. Many radiotracers utilized in PET are useful for the targeting of AD hallmarks, such as β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Examples include: 11C-PiB, 18F-Florbetaben, 18F-Flortaucipir, etc…
