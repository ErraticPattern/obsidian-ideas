# Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging
It measures degrees of intensities. Different MRI techniques can be distinguished by the strength of the magnetic field produced by the MRI machine, which is measure in Tesla (T).

Figure 13. Representative cross-section of a superconducting scanner showing nested arrangement of "coils". Both superconducting and resistive shim coils are shown. Two different types of patient coils are also illustrated: a receive only spine coil array, and a transmit/receive knee coil.

**Gradients** are sets of electromagnets located behind the walls of MR scanners used for spatial encoding and signal generation. Gradients distort the main magnetic field in a predictable fashion, causing the resonance frequency of protons to vary as a function of position. The strength of the magnetic fields generated by gradients are less than 3% of the main magnetic field (Bo), so their static effects are of no concern. Rather, it is the time rate of change of these gradient fields (dB/dt) that poses potential safety issues for MR imaging.

An **MRI sequence** is a particular setting of radiofrequency pulses and gradients, resulting in a particular image appearance. The T1 and T2 weighting can also be described as MRI sequences.

Figure 15. Pulse sequence is the basis of MRI. RF stands for radio frequency.

A single RF pulse generates a **free induction decay (FID)**, but two successive RF pulses produce a spin echo (SE). The time between the middle of the first RF pulse and the peak of the spin echo is called the echo time (TE).

Different tissues will show different magnetic properties and so different techniques in MRI data acquisition can highlight different biological structures. Each tissue returns to its equilibrium state after excitation by the independent relaxation processes of **T1** (spin-lattice; that is, magnetization in the same direction as the static magnetic field) and **T2** (spin-spin; transverse to the static magnetic field). To create a T1-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to recover before measuring the MR signal by changing the repetition time (TR). This image weighting is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex, identifying fatty tissue, characterizing focal liver lesions, and in general, obtaining morphological information, as well as for post-contrast imaging. To create a T2-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to decay before measuring the MR signal by changing the echo time (TE). This image weighting is useful for detecting edema and inflammation, revealing white matter lesions, and assessing zonal anatomy in the prostate and uterus.
