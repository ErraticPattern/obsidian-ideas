# Electromyography (EMG)

It can be used evoked potentials to calculate axonal conduction velocity. Factors such as position of the electrodes and temperature ([[#^footnote-32|Comment Unknown Author 32]]) affect it. From the signal one can obtain several parameters such as latency/duration, amplitude/area, and velocity. From these one can deduce pathological settings, such as the loss of myelin, muscle fibers or axons.

**CMAP** stands for Compound Muscle Action Potential, and it is an electrophysiological test that measures the electrical activity of the muscles in response to nerve stimulation. These tests are usually performed on the median (around 200 motor units ([[#^footnote-33|Comment Unknown Author 33]])) or ulnar nerves for motor and sensory nerve fibres’ assessment ([[#^footnote-34|Comment Unknown Author 34]]). Importantly, the morphology of the signal (**M wave**) is always the same for the same nerve fibre. Additionally, because the fingers have no muscles, it is the ideal location for the reference electrode.

Another component of EMG tests are late responses, such as the **F waves**, which occur due to a opposite AP direction to that of the M wave, which then reaches the spinal cord and excites around 2/3 % of motor fibres, which result in a late AP. Although the F wave is variable in amplitude since different axons are stimulated each time, it is still highly consistent in its parameters across the population, making it a good way to diagnose motor neuron diseases.

The **H reflex** is a response dependent on the monosynaptic reflex arch of the muscle. It is usually performed on the posteriori tibial nerve. M and H waves can sometimes collide and cancel each other.

EMG can also be used for the **MUNE** (Motor Unit Number Estimation) test which is a medical test used to evaluate the health of motor neurons in the body.

**Repetitive stimulation** is a EMG technique that allows the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis, since signal amplitude decreases after each stimuli, and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, whose patients’ signal amplitude increases after each burst of stimuli.

**Single fibre EMG** records a single or few muscle fibers. This serves as a diagnostic tool for Myasthenia Gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.
