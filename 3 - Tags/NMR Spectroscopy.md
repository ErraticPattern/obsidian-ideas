# Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) is a spectroscopic technique based on re-orientation of atomic nuclei with non-zero nuclear spins in an external magnetic field. It is used to study the physical, chemical, and biological properties of matter. It is more useful for molecular neuroscience.
