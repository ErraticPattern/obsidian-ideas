## γ-camera/single photon emission computed tomography 

It collects energy coming from γ-decay. It allows for a 3D reconstruction of the brain since the machine moves around the patient. It has a spatial resolution of ~10 mm, which is dependent on the energies of the γ-rays. One example of utilized neuropharmaceutical is the 99mTc-HMPAO, which is a lipophilic agent and crosses the BBB. Furthermore, it is metabolized intracellularly which inhibits its diffusion to outside the cell; its intracellular accumulation is proportional the blood flow of the specific area. 123I-Ioflupano has affinity for DAT transporters.
