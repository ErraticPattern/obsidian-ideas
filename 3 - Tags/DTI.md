## Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
Diffusion imaging is an advanced MRI technique based on optimised pulse sequences, which permits the quantification of the diffusion characteristics of water molecules inside biological tissues (Le Bihan and Breton, 1985). Given that cerebral white matter contains axons, and that water molecules diffuse more freely along axons than across them (Moseley et al., 1990), it is possible to obtain in vivo estimates of white matter fibre orientation by measuring the diffusivity of water molecules along different directions (Basser et al., 1994). Information from Catani, Dellâ€™Acqua, and Thiebaut de Schotten 2013.
