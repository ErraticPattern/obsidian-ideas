## Parent note
[[EEG]]
## Comments
+ Beta and Gamma bands are more exposed to artifacts.
+ Alpha is quite protected.
+ Low-frequency activity might also be prone to artifacts. It might be why the EEG is usually described with a 1/f curve. This was mentioned by [[Makoto Miyakoshi]] (and [[Paul L. Nunez]]) in [[On preprocessing EEG data]].
+ ICA can be used to clean EEG data by rejecting [[independent components]]. These ICs can be rejected by not following the [[1-f-like distribution]] since brain activity loosely follows this distribution.
