> A single minicolumn or even a single macrocolumn (containing about $1000$ minicolumns or $100,000$ pyramidal cells) is not expected to generate a dipole moment of sufficient strength to produce scalp potentials in the recordable range of a few microvolts.

> The tissue label "synchronously active" in this context is based on cortical recordings with macroscopic electrodes and must be viewed mainly as a qualitative description. In the case of dipole layers in fissures and sulci, tissue areas larger than $6 cm^2$ are apparently required to produce measurable scalp potentials.

As such [[diffusion physics]] is still restrained on the amount of cortical activation in order to produce measurable electrical activity in the range of $\mu$$V$. [[Neuron]] arrangement geometry is also thought to aid signal strength, i.e. the parallel arrangement of [[Pyramidal cell]] dendritic axes encourages superposition of fields from many individual synaptic sources ,by forming large [[Dipole layers]].

## Clean EEG
Clean EEG should be stationary ([[On preprocessing EEG data]]). However, its ambiguity makes it an unpopular concept to assess whether the data is clean.
