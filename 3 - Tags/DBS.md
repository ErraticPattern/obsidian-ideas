# Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)

It consists of the stimulation of deep brain regions. It requires the access to these regions and therefore DBS was only possible due to an advancement in the field of stereotaxis. It is an invasive procedure, but it rarely results in cognitive impairment. The DBS electrode can have several configurations and extremely large number of ways to stimulate the neuronal tissue. The standard electrode configuration is quadripolar, with four stimulating electrode contacts at the tip of the probe, which is 1.27 mm in diameter. The macroelectrode section measure local field potentials (LFPs) and microelectrodes can measure single Aps, due to their extremely high resistance.

Figure 130. a | Common electrode configurations for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Dark grey regions illustrate electrode contacts, which can be activated to deliver current. Electrode designs vary with regard to the spacing between contacts as well as the number and shape of contacts. Greater contact spacing expands the range of neural targets, whereas smaller contact spacing facilitates more precise stimulation control. b | Modes of stimulation, depending on the type of DBS system in use. Unipolar stimulation refers to current being directed from the battery to the contact or vice versa. Bipolar stimulation indicates current flowing between electrode contacts, with at least one functioning as an anode and one as a cathode. Interleaving stimulation refers to the alternation of different stimulation settings. Multiple level stimulation enables multiple neural targets to be stimulated, provided that they lie along the electrode trajectory. With directional stimulation, current can be directed or ‘shaped’ on the basis of local anatomy or clinical symptoms (Krauss et al., 2021).

Different configurations can modulate the electromagnetic field, making it more focal and concentrated or less so. DBS systems that both record and produce stimuli are called closed-loop, with the goal of responding quickly to electrical signals in order to produce an adequate response. A separate reference electrode can be used but new technology is making it obsolete.

Figure 131. Monopolar/Bipolar electrode configuration. A monopolar configuration will only have one electrode with current dissipating in the vicinity of that electrode with no current flowing into another electrode. Electric current density is more diffuse and radially symmetric in monopolar configurations. In bipolar configurations, a closed-loop circuit has current flowing from the working electrode to the counterelectrode, thereby allowing a narrower volume of tissue affected. Current steering uses electrodes with multiple directional surfaces to control deliver of current more specifically (Aum & Tierney, 2018).

## Use of DBS

DBS is mainly used for movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, and other diseases like epilepsy. Some regions of interest include the SN, Gpi, STN, and Vim ([[#^footnote-37|Comment Unknown Author 37]]).

Figure 136. [[Basal ganglia]] structures. This illustration of a coronal cross-section of the brain depicts the major basal ganglia structures: (1) The [[substantia nigra]] (SN) and its innervation to the [[striatum]]. (2) The putamen and caudate nucleus which comprise the striatum. (3) The [[globus pallidus externus]] (GPe) and [[globus pallidus internus]] (GPi). (4) The [[subthalamic nucleus]] (STN). The thalamus and the cortex, which provides multiple inputs to the striatum are also labelled (Aum & Tierney, 2018).
