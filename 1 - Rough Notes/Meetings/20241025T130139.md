## Topics
+ With [[Diego Andrés Blanco-Mora]]
+ Burns Paper (BAP) - Berns, G. S. , & Moore, S. E. ,. (2011). A neural predictor of cultural popularity. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 22(1), 154–160. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2011.05.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2011.05.001)
+ Basically he said that he regards doing correlations between model analysis as "fishing for results" and introduces bias.
+ He preprocessed the data using a custom [[MATLAB]] pipeline and an [[EGI]]-based preprocessing. He claims the latter is unfit for publication due to its "black-box" nature although it might have resulted in cleaner data. He claims he was working on a third pipeline with  a top scientist but which was not finished.
