## To do
- [x] 🛫 2024-10-01  ⏫ Start creating overleaf
- [-] Get back on Mark about the solution to the source estimation problem. -> I found the solution. You cannot export epoched data otherwise weird things will happen. For the future I need to understand if there is a way to map dipoles to anatomical regions using MNI or Talairach.
