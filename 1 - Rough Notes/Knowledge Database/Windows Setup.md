# Machine
## GPU
If applicable update your GPU drivers. For example, it is possible to utilize GPU in [[MATLAB]] computations using the `gpuArray` function.
# Setup
## E-mails
Always have 4 compulsory distinct e-mails:
1. Professional/Academic use (e.g. joao-amaro@edu.uliaboa.pt)
2. Personal use (e.g. joaopvamaro@gmail.com)
3. For app sign-ins (prone to spam) (e.g. joao.amaro_91@hotmail.com) - **This e-mail has been leaked (see HIBP).**
4. Outlook e-mail for windows (e.g. joaopvamaro@outlook.com)
5. *(Optional)* Spam e-mail for gmail (e.g. jonnytuga91@gmail.com)

Use gmail for more free cloud data and use outlook for microsoft apps such those of Microsoft Office.

For example, `https://ErraticPattern@github.com` can be associated with the ``ErraticPattern`` user. Note that you need to be logged out of all your github accounts when saving your credentials.

# Secundary Apps
## Privacy
+ **KeePass 2**
This app contains all passwords based on one master key.
## Social
### Whatsapp
### Discord
# Work
## Servers
+ **Synology**
## Remote Connection
+ **RustDesk**
Open source tool for remote connection. Sometimes the official serves will be down which is why it is recommended to create a personal LAN from which both computers can communicate. Install **[[ZeroTier]]** to create this connection.
+ [[ZeroTier]]
Install on both local and remote machines. Create a network by logging in to the browser website and creating a network. Add both machines to the network. Go to RustDesk and enable connection by IP address. Specify the correct port and make sure the port can be read by the remote machine (use `ipconfig` and `netstat`). Input the connection value - Ip address followed by the port number (e.g. `10.147.17.103:21118`).
+ **TeamViewer**
More specifically the free version. The app can be setup by downloading ``TeamViewer Host``. This app should be used when *RustDesk* is not working properly or to set it up correctly. This app is not recommended for privacy reasons and for its sudden disconnections (there seems to be some limited time of use). 
## Note taking
### Obsidian
#### Plug-ins:
The plug-ins are specified in my main obsidian vaults.
### LogSeq
[See here.](https://logseq.com/)
## LaTeX
Latex is useful for neat formatting and mathematical notation. It can be used both online and offline.
### Overleaf
It is free online latex editor. It can be used for writing a project with a team. It can easily be integrated with reference managers such as Zotero by utilizing `.bib` formats.
Use stored LaTeX templates to write your documents, including articles.
## Biobliography
### Zotero
**Plugins:**
+ Night Mode
+ Better Bibtex
+ Duplicate Merger
+ [MuiseDestiny/zotero-reference: PDF references add-on for Zotero. (github.com)](https://github.com/MuiseDestiny/zotero-reference)
Documentation and help on how to use this addon can be found here -> [Is it possible to extract references from article pdfs/webpage? - Zotero Forums](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/103205/is-it-possible-to-extract-references-from-article-pdfs-webpage)

**Other tools:**
+ [AnyStyle.io](https://anystyle.io/)
Use this tool to bulk-export references from papers.

**Considerations:**
+ Syncing file quota of 300MB
See how to avoid reaching this limit here -> [300MB storage limit - Zotero Forums](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/107686/300mb-storage-limit)
### *(Optional)* Mendeley
+ Use Mendely as a backup option for Zotero.
## Research Rabbit

# Utils
### Applications
+ **OneCommander**
Use to get a macOS touch to your file explorer. Extremely useful in cases where you need to quickly access files across many folders.
+ **Text Grab**
*Source:* [TheJoeFin/Text-Grab: Use OCR in Windows quickly and easily with Text Grab. With optional background process and notifications. (github.com)](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Text-Grab)
+ **Tree Size**
Useful to assess how your memory is being used.
+ **Notepad++**
Extremely useful for text formatting. Use plugins for maximum functionality. Useful plugins: `CsvQuery` and `Code alignment`.
### Browser-based
+ **Transfer.zip**
Very useful for transferring files of unlimited size. It utilizes a QR code or a link which will then open a browser on the recipient's machine and begin the file transfer. It is a much better alternative to `wetransfer`.
# Browsers
## Firefox
I am currently using Firefox since it is open source.
## Microsoft Edge
Right now, Microsoft Edge is my main browser. There are 3 main reasons for my choice:
* It provided AI tools in the beginning if the AI era.
* It allows the conversion of points for gift cards.
* Contains the add-ons I want.
## Google Chrome
The main reason to utilize Chrome is to use plugins otherwise unavailable on firefox (or edge). Examples include using `Obsidian Web Clipper` with `Glasp`.
## Add-ons
## Websites
