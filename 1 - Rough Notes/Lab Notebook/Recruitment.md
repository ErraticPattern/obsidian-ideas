# Calendar
## Adding busy periods
You can add periods of rest by creating a repeating event. For example, define a lunch break repeating exam in order to disallow acquisitions at those times and prevent sequential acquisitions at lunch time.
## Appointments for participants
Create a calendar using Google Calendar. Then create a bookable appointment schedule.
