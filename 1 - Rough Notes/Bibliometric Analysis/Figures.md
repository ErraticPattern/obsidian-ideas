# Export
It is very important to ensure you are exporting high-quality figures into your papers. Here are a few tips to ensure that.
## Export from Power-Point
Always work with a high-resolution screen. It is known that screenshot quality is dependent on screen resolution [source](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/sharper-screenshots/46a1bc8c-ca80-46e4-ba32-9606cb7b0510). 
+ PPI (pixels per inch)
Power-point exports images with 96 PPI by default. This can be changed by following the steps detailed in [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/powerpoint/change-export-slide-resolution). To check the PPI of any image, open it using paint and hit `Ctrl+E`. The PPI value is detailed in the `Resolution` field.
