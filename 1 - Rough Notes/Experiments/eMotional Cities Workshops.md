## Neuroarchitecture
It was very fun. I went with Alice and Pedro. Very similar organization to the [[Brain Innovation Days]] event, except on a smaller scale.
## Copenhagen Event
Interesting and fun event. Interesting since it gave me an idea of how the different people involved in a project play their part, some more successfully than others and why it is important to "Vender o peixe".
