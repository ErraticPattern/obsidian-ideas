# Description
**Title**
```
NOVEL DATA COLLECTION UNIT WITH EEG, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS FOR OUTDOOR URBAN ENVIRONMENTS
```

**Abstract**
```
The rapid urbanisation of global populations has amplified the need to understand the complex relationship between urban environments and mental health. Traditional indoor laboratory-based studies, while controlled, often lack ecological validity in this context. A critical challenge in the emerging field of "neurourbanism" is the difficulty in collecting comprehensive, real-time neurophysiological and environmental data in naturalistic urban settings, limiting our understanding of how urban features directly impact mental states and well-being.

To address this, we introduce the "Pluma" backpack, an innovative wearable data collection unit designed for high-quality, multimodal data acquisition in dynamic urban environments. The Pluma backpack integrates a comprehensive array of sensors, including environmental monitors (e.g., temperature, wind speed, particulate matter) and physiological sensors such as eye-tracking, electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Its ergonomic design, combined with an integrated software framework based on the Bonsai programming language, enables seamless data synchronisation at both spatial and temporal levels.

Outdoor walks with the Pluma backpack were conducted in Lisbon, Michigan, London, and Copenhagen, involving healthy adult participants across various age groups, navigating diverse urban environments. These acquisitions achieved a high success rate in collecting synchronised neurophysiological, physiological, and environmental data, with only rare instances of sensor malfunction. Throughout these sessions, participants successfully completed 20-minute walks with little to no discomfort, highlighting the device's ergonomic design and practicality.

The Pluma backpack represents a pivotal methodological advancement in neurourbanism, effectively bridging the gap between controlled laboratory experiments and real-world urban experiences. By enhancing ecological validity in neuro-urbanistic research, this technology paves the way for new research avenues into the neural correlates of urban living. Insights from such studies could inform evidence-based urban planning policies that promote mental well-being, ultimately fostering more psychologically supportive urban environments. Furthermore, the Pluma backpack sets a new standard for multimodal data acquisition in outdoor settings, establishing a foundation for future technological innovations in this field.

**30-second Pitch**

Good morning, everyone! As we all know, urban environments greatly impact our physical and mental health, and as more people move into cities there is a pressing need to better understand this relationship. For this reason, we have developed a novel wearable device: a backpack equipped with environmental and physiological sensors, including EEG to monitor brain activity. Its purpose is to accelerate findings in this complex field of neurourbanism as it can used in virtuallyevery urban context and by anyone. Therefore, I invite you to later come and get a close-up view of the backpack to better understand how it works. Thank you.

# Appendix
## Commentaries
The [[Brain Innovation Days]] was my first event as a presenter. I presented the backpack from [[Emotional Cities - Experiment nÂº4]]. While it did not start off well, mostly due to lack of engagement by the small crowd it progressively got better. Unfortunately, I did not get the time to visit the city, and the place where I was staying was not the best. However, what really made me extremely happy to have participated in the event was the people I met. I met Angel from [[Starlab]]; I met Moritz, a neuroscientist from [[IDUN Technologies]] that also attended BOOM festival; I met Carolina, which was part of the [[HaDEA]], which funded the emotional cities project; and finally, I met Ana which was such a sweet girl and definitely provided me the best memories of the event. I loved being with her and it broke my heart to leave because I wanted to spend more time with her. There were also other interesting people which I met, but the previous ones were the ones that marked this adventure. I met Julien, the CEO of Cortex Machina. He was a bit of a child though.

NOVEL DATA COLLECTION UNIT FOR EEG AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATA ACQUISITION IN OUTDOOR URBANISTIC ENVIRONMENTS

**Abstract (draft)**
```
The rapid urbanisation of global populations has intensified the need to understand the intricate relationship between urban environments and mental health. Traditional laboratory-based studies, while controlled, often lack ecological validity when investigating this complex interplay.

A significant hurdle in this new field of "neurourbanism" research has been the inability to collect comprehensive, real-time neurophysiological and environmental data in naturalistic urban settings. This gap limits our understanding of how urban features directly impact mental states and well-being in real-world scenarios.

We introduce an innovative wearable data collection unit, the "Pluma" backpack, designed to overcome these limitations and enable high-quality, multimodal data acquisition in dynamic urban environments.

The Pluma backpack contains a comprehensive array of sensors including: environmental sensors (e.g. temperature, wind speed, particulate matter), physiological sensors such as eye-tracking, electrocardiogram (ECG), and the electroencephalogram (EEG). The backpack's ergonomic design and integrated software framework, based on the Bonsai programming language, enable seamless data synchronisation at the spatial and temporal levels.

The Pluma backpack has been used in outdoor experiments in Lisbon, Michigan, London, and Copenhagen, by voluntary participants which wore it while walking through diverse urban environments. Preliminary findings demonstrate the feasibility of collecting high-quality, multimodal data during urban walks. The Pluma backpack successfully captured synchronized neurophysiological, physiological, and environmental data, providing a comprehensive picture of participants' experiences in different urban settings. Initial analyses reveal correlations between specific urban features (e.g., green spaces, traffic density) and changes in brain activity patterns and physiological responses.

The Pluma backpack represents a significant methodological advancement in brain research, enabling the study of neural activity in real-world urban contexts, an area of research stemming from the established relationship between urbanistic features and mental health. This innovation bridges the gap between controlled laboratory experiments and naturalistic urban experiences, offering new possibilities for investigating the neural correlates of living in an urban setting.

This technology opens new avenues for research in environmental neuroscience and urban psychology, facilitating studies with enhanced ecological validity. The insights gained could inform new approaches to mental health preservation, considering environmental factors more comprehensively. More importantly, the ultimate goal is that data from studies making use of such devices could inform evidence-based urban planning policies aimed at promoting mental well-being. Ultimately, this research could contribute to the design of more psychologically supportive urban environments, benefiting the mental health of city dwellers globally. Lastly, this technological device demonstrates the feasibility of multi-modal data acquisition in outdoor setting, establishing itself as the standard from which future technologies could be developed.

In conclusion, the Pluma backpack and its application in neurourbanism research represent a significant step towards understanding the complex relationships between urban living and mental health, with far-reaching implications for brain science, urban planning, and public health.
