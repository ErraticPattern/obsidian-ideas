# The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a prefrontal cortex region in the frontal lobes of the brain which is involved in the cognitive process of decision-making. In non-human primates it consists of the association cortex areas Brodmann area 11, 12 and 13; in humans it consists of Brodmann area 10, 11 and 47 ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitofrontal_cortex)).
