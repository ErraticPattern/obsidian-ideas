# Thalamus

Functions as the gateway of the cortex. It integrates every type of sensory information, except smell. The fiber connections have been established, and, following removal of the cortex, the thalamus can appreciate crude sensations. However, the cerebral cortex is required for the interpretation of sensations based on past experiences. Very interesting! – (see page 395 of Snell’s).

## Nuclei

- Anterior

Anterior nucleus involved with the limbic lobe and cingulate gyrus (Papez circuit).

- Medial

Dorsomedial nucleus and other smaller nuclei. The first connects heavily with the frontal lobe, responsible for behaviour and motivation, and hypothalamus. Integrates sensory information, visceral and somatic.

- Lateral (anterior – motor cortex/ posterior – sensory cortex)
- Ventral

VA, VL (these two connect with basal ganglia are motor related), VP – VPL and VPM (divided into 2 and sense related)

- Dorsal

LD (limbic system with anterior nucleus), LP and Pulvinar (last two heavily related to integration of visual information)

- Internal medullary lamina

intralaminar nuclei (connects with reticular formation through the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS))

- Interthalamic connection

midline nuclei (connect to reticular formation)

- Periphery of thalamus

**Reticular nucleus** (Thalamic reticular nucleus) is a thin layer of nerve cells sandwiched between the external medullary lamina and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. It contains cells that have spontaneous rhythmic oscillatory activity, which generate sleep spindles.

**Medial geniculate body** (auditory pathway).

**Lateral geniculate body** (visual pathway).

## White matter

- The thalamus is covered on its superior surface by a thin layer of white matter, called the stratum zonale, and on Its lateral surface by another layer, the external medullary lamina.
- Internal medullary lamina (Y-shaped, divides thalamus and contains some nuclei).
